As the country grapples with a myriad of pressing issues, including economic recovery, social justice, and healthcare, the deep divisions between political factions have become increasingly apparent.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%The divide between the left and the right has become a chasm, with each side firmly entrenched in its own ideology and unwilling to compromise. The result is a political deadlock that has hindered progress on critical policy matters, leaving the American people frustrated and disillusioned.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%One of the key factors driving this polarization is the rise of identity politics. Issues such as race, gender, and religion have become central to political discourse, with both sides using them as rallying points for their respective bases. This focus on identity has further deepened the divide, as each side accuses the other of being out of touch or insensitive to the concerns of marginalized groups.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Another contributing factor is the influence of social media on political discourse. The rapid spread of information and the ease with which it can be manipulated have allowed for the creation of echo chambers, where individuals are surrounded by like-minded individuals and shielded from opposing viewpoints. This has led to a reinforcement of existing beliefs and a dismissal of alternative perspectives, further exacerbating the polarization.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Furthermore, the erosion of trust in institutions has played a significant role in the current political climate. From government agencies to the media, public faith in these institutions has been eroded by scandals, misinformation, and perceived biases. This lack of trust has fueled skepticism and conspiracy theories, making it even more challenging to find common ground.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%The upcoming elections, both at the national and local levels, will be crucial in determining the future direction of the country. With the stakes higher than ever, politicians must make a concerted effort to bridge the divide and find common ground. Compromise and collaboration will be essential in addressing the pressing issues facing the nation.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%However, it is not solely the responsibility of politicians to heal the rift. As citizens, we must also engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with those who hold different viewpoints. It is through open and honest conversations that we can begin to find common ground and work towards shared goals.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%The road to political unity will be challenging, but it is not impossible. It requires a collective effort to move beyond partisan bickering and towards a more inclusive and collaborative political landscape. Only then can we hope to address the pressing issues that face our nation and build a better future for all Americans.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Image: [Caption: People from diverse backgrounds engaging in a political discussion.]%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%---%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Please note that the article is solely for illustrative purposes and does not represent any actual events or opinions.

47,,Germany's Political Landscape: A Complex Web of Power%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Germany, often hailed as the economic powerhouse of Europe, boasts a political landscape that is as intricate as it is influential. With a parliamentary system that encourages coalition-building and a multiparty democracy, the nation's politics are a delicate balance of power and compromise.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%At the heart of Germany's political system is the Bundestag, the federal parliament. Comprised of 709 members, known as Bundestagsabgeordnete, it is the primary legislative body responsible for passing laws and representing the interests of the German people. The Bundestag is elected every four years through a mixed-member proportional representation system, ensuring a diverse range of voices are heard.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%The two major political parties in Germany are the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The CDU, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, is a center-right party that has dominated German politics for the past decade. On the other hand, the SPD, currently led by Olaf Scholz, is a center-left party that has traditionally championed social justice and workers' rights.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%However, Germany's political landscape extends far beyond these two parties. The country is home to a plethora of smaller parties, each with their own unique ideologies and priorities. The Green Party, for example, advocates for environmental sustainability, while the Free Democratic Party (FDP) champions liberal economic policies. The Left Party, as its name suggests, focuses on social equality and redistribution of wealth. These smaller parties often play a crucial role in coalition governments, as no single party usually secures an outright majority in the Bundestag.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Coalition-building is a defining feature of German politics. In order to form a government, parties must negotiate and compromise with one another. This often leads to intricate power-sharing arrangements and policy compromises, ensuring a diversity of perspectives are represented in governance.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In recent years, Germany has witnessed the rise of right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD). With its anti-immigration and Eurosceptic stance, the party has garnered significant support, particularly in the eastern regions of the country. The rise of AfD has added a new dimension to Germany's political landscape, challenging the traditional dominance of the CDU and SPD.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Germany's political landscape is also influenced by the role of the federal states, known as Länder. Each Land has its own regional parliament, and the state governments play a crucial role in shaping policy on a local level. This decentralized approach ensures that regional interests are taken into account in national decision-making processes.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%As Germany heads into a new era with Chancellor Merkel's impending departure, the political landscape is likely to undergo further transformation. The upcoming federal elections will determine the country's future direction, with potential shifts in power dynamics and coalition possibilities.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Navigating the complexities of Germany's political landscape requires a keen understanding of the various parties, their ideologies, and their ability to form coalitions. The decisions made in the Bundestag and the negotiations behind closed doors shape the policies that impact the lives of millions of Germans.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In a world where political stability is increasingly challenged, Germany's intricate web of power stands as a testament to the strength of its democracy. As the nation continues to navigate its political landscape, the world watches closely, recognizing the importance of Germany's role in shaping Europe and beyond.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Image captions:%%NEWLINE%%1.

From self-driving cars to voice assistants, AI has become an integral part of our daily lives. Companies are utilizing AI to streamline operations, improve customer service, and enhance productivity. However, the rise of AI has also raised concerns about job displacement and ethical considerations surrounding privacy and data security.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Technology has also transformed the way we conduct business. The rise of e-commerce has revolutionized the retail industry, allowing consumers to shop from the comfort of their homes. Online marketplaces have provided small businesses with a platform to reach a global audience, leveling the playing field and fostering entrepreneurship. Furthermore, digital payment systems and blockchain technology are reshaping the financial sector, making transactions faster, more secure, and accessible.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In the healthcare sector, technology has led to significant advancements in diagnostics, treatment, and patient care. Medical devices, such as wearable fitness trackers and remote monitoring systems, have empowered individuals to take control of their health. Telemedicine has also gained traction, enabling patients to receive medical consultation and treatment remotely. These technological advancements have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes and increase accessibility, particularly in underserved areas.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%However, as technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to address the challenges it presents. The digital divide, for instance, highlights the disparity in access to technology between different socioeconomic groups. Bridging this gap is essential to ensure equal opportunities for all. Additionally, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, cybersecurity, and the responsible use of AI need to be addressed to ensure that technology benefits society as a whole.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In conclusion, technology has become an inseparable part of our lives, reshaping the way we communicate, learn, work, and conduct business. While it brings numerous benefits and opportunities, it also poses challenges that must be addressed. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to strike a balance between innovation and responsible use to ensure a better future for all.

However, research continually highlights the crucial role that quality sleep plays in maintaining optimal health. From improved cognitive function to a stronger immune system, the benefits of prioritizing sleep are undeniable.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Scientists and health experts have long emphasized the significance of sleep in supporting overall well-being. During sleep, our bodies undergo a series of restorative processes that contribute to physical and mental rejuvenation. While we sleep, our brains consolidate memories, repair tissues, regulate hormone levels, and strengthen the immune system. These vital functions are essential for maintaining good health and warding off various medical conditions.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%One of the most notable benefits of quality sleep is its impact on cognitive function. Adequate sleep has been linked to improved memory, concentration, and problem-solving abilities. Research suggests that sleep deprivation can impair cognitive performance, affecting our judgment, decision-making skills, and even our ability to learn. By prioritizing sleep, individuals can enhance their mental acuity and overall productivity.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Furthermore, sleep plays a pivotal role in maintaining a robust immune system.

On the other hand, regular, quality sleep has been associated with a strengthened immune response, reducing the risk of illnesses and promoting faster recovery.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Sleep also plays a critical role in managing weight and promoting a healthy metabolism. Lack of sleep has been linked to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie, sugary foods.

Prioritizing sleep can help individuals maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of related health conditions.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In our modern society, where technology and screens dominate our lives, it is becoming increasingly challenging to achieve quality sleep. The blue light emitted by electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and get a restful night's rest. Establishing a nighttime routine that includes avoiding screens before bed and creating a calm, sleep-friendly environment can significantly improve sleep quality.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Experts recommend aiming for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night, allowing time for the body to complete its essential restorative processes. Prioritizing sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and practicing relaxation techniques before bed, can contribute to better sleep quality.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%In conclusion, the significance of quality sleep cannot be overstated when it comes to maintaining optimal health. From improved cognitive function to a strengthened immune system and better weight management, the benefits of prioritizing sleep are far-reaching. As we navigate our busy lives, let us remember that a good night's sleep is not a luxury but a necessity for our overall well-being. So, let's make sleep a priority and unlock the key to a healthier, happier life.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%*Image Source: Pexels.com*

40,,Title: The Power of Authenticity in Influencer Marketing%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Introduction:%%NEWLINE%%In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives. It has not only transformed the way we communicate but has also revolutionized the marketing landscape. Influencer marketing has emerged as a powerful strategy for brands to connect with their target audience. However, in a world filled with sponsored content and paid endorsements, the key to success lies in authenticity. In this blog post, we will explore the power of authenticity in influencer marketing and why it matters more than ever.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%1. Building Trust:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity is the foundation of trust in influencer marketing. When influencers genuinely believe in a product or service, their audience can sense it. Genuine recommendations and personal experiences resonate with followers, leading to higher trust levels. In contrast, forced or inauthentic endorsements can damage the influencer's credibility and erode the trust of their audience. Brands need to prioritize working with influencers who align with their values and can promote their products or services genuinely.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%2. Creating Meaningful Connections:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity allows influencers to establish meaningful connections with their audience. When influencers share their personal stories, struggles, and triumphs, they become relatable and inspire their followers. By being authentic, influencers can create a sense of community, fostering engagement and loyalty. Brands can leverage this connection by partnering with influencers who can authentically integrate their products or services into their content, leading to more genuine engagement and positive brand sentiment.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%3. Driving Engagement and Conversion:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity drives engagement and conversion rates. When influencers genuinely promote a product or service, their audience is more likely to engage with the content, leave comments, and share it with their own networks. This increased engagement not only boosts brand visibility but also drives organic reach. Furthermore, when influencers personally vouch for a product, their audience is more likely to convert into customers. Authenticity creates a ripple effect, leading to increased sales and brand loyalty.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%4. Navigating the Rise of Micro-Influencers:%%NEWLINE%%In recent years, there has been a shift towards working with micro-influencers - those with smaller but highly engaged followings. These influencers often excel in authenticity, as their content feels more personal and relatable. By collaborating with micro-influencers, brands can tap into niche audiences and foster genuine connections. Micro-influencers are seen as more trustworthy, and their recommendations carry more weight due to their authenticity.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%5. Balancing Authenticity with Brand Guidelines:%%NEWLINE%%While authenticity is crucial, it's essential to strike a balance between influencer creativity and brand guidelines. Brands should provide influencers with guidelines that align with their values and objectives while still allowing room for creativity. This ensures that the content remains authentic while promoting the brand's message effectively.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Conclusion:%%NEWLINE%%In the ever-evolving world of influencer marketing, authenticity reigns supreme. Brands must prioritize working with influencers who genuinely align with their values and can authentically promote their products or services. By building trust, creating meaningful connections, driving engagement and conversion, and navigating the rise of micro-influencers, brands can harness the power of authenticity to stand out in the crowded social media landscape. Remember, authenticity is not just a buzzword; it's the key to success in influencer marketing.

Building Trust and Credibility:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity is the foundation upon which trust and credibility are built. In an era where consumers are increasingly skeptical of traditional advertising, influencers who genuinely believe in and use the products or services they promote can establish a deep sense of trust with their audience. By being transparent about their experiences and offering honest reviews, influencers can help bridge the gap between brands and consumers, leading to stronger connections and increased credibility for both parties involved.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%2. Creating Meaningful Connections:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity goes beyond mere product endorsements; it is about creating meaningful connections with the audience. Influencers who share personal stories, struggles, and triumphs can resonate with their followers on a deeper level. By being vulnerable and relatable, influencers can foster a sense of community and inspire their audience to engage with the brand on a more emotional level. This connection not only boosts brand loyalty but also drives the desired actions, such as purchases or referrals.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%3. Standing Out in a Saturated Market:%%NEWLINE%%With the rise in influencer marketing, social media feeds have become inundated with sponsored content. To cut through the noise, influencers must differentiate themselves by being authentic. By staying true to their own unique voice, values, and interests, influencers can build a distinct personal brand that sets them apart from the crowd. Brands that align themselves with genuine influencers benefit from this differentiation, as their message reaches an engaged and receptive audience.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%4. Nurturing Long-term Relationships:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity is not a one-time strategy; it is a long-term commitment. Brands that prioritize building relationships with influencers based on authenticity are more likely to enjoy sustainable success. When influencers genuinely believe in a brand, they become brand advocates, consistently promoting the products or services beyond sponsored posts. These long-term partnerships not only yield better results in terms of engagement and conversions but also contribute to a positive brand image.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%5. Dealing with Controversies:%%NEWLINE%%Influencers are not immune to controversies, and how they handle these situations can make or break their authenticity. When faced with criticism or negative feedback, influencers who address the issues openly, take responsibility, and learn from their mistakes can salvage their reputation and maintain trust with their audience. Brands that stand by their authentic influencers during challenging times show their commitment to transparency and integrity, further strengthening their own reputation.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Conclusion:%%NEWLINE%%Authenticity is the driving force behind successful influencer marketing campaigns. It builds trust, creates meaningful connections, helps influencers stand out in a saturated market, nurtures long-term relationships, and enables influencers to navigate controversies effectively. Brands that prioritize authenticity in their influencer partnerships will not only see short-term benefits but also establish a solid foundation for long-term success in the ever-evolving world of social media marketing.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Remember, in a world full of filters and staged content, authenticity is the key to making a lasting impact on your audience.

Join me as we explore the fascinating world of coral reefs and their significance in environmental conservation and sustainability.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%1. Unveiling the Beauty:%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Coral reefs are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea" due to their unparalleled beauty and biodiversity. The vivid colors and intricate structures of coral colonies create a mesmerizing underwater landscape that attracts divers, snorkelers, and scientists alike. From the Great Barrier Reef in Australia to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System in the Caribbean, these natural wonders are home to an incredible array of marine species, including fish, turtles, sharks, and countless others.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%2. Ecosystem Engineers:%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Beyond their stunning aesthetics, coral reefs are vital ecosystem engineers. They provide shelter, breeding grounds, and feeding areas for numerous marine organisms, supporting a delicate web of life. Coral polyps, the tiny animals responsible for building the reefs, form symbiotic relationships with algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide corals with essential nutrients through photosynthesis, while corals offer them a protective habitat. This mutually beneficial partnership ensures the survival of both species and sustains the entire reef ecosystem.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%3. Climate Change Warriors:%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Coral reefs are at the forefront of the battle against climate change. They act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This process helps mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, playing a crucial role in regulating our climate. However, rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification, caused by climate change, pose a significant threat to coral reefs worldwide. The phenomenon known as coral bleaching occurs when corals expel their zooxanthellae due to stress, leading to a loss of color and ultimately death. Protecting coral reefs is not just about preserving their beauty; it's about safeguarding the health of our planet.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%4. Conservation Efforts:%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Given their ecological importance, conserving and restoring coral reefs have become critical priorities for scientists, environmentalists, and governments worldwide. Various conservation initiatives aim to protect vulnerable coral ecosystems through measures such as marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and the reduction of pollution and coastal development. Additionally, research focuses on developing innovative techniques, like coral gardening and assisted evolution, to help reefs recover from damage and adapt to changing environmental conditions.%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%Conclusion:%%NEWLINE%%%%NEWLINE%%As we conclude our exploration of the fascinating world of coral reefs, let's reflect on the invaluable role they play in maintaining ocean biodiversity and combating climate change. These fragile ecosystems are not only a sight to behold but also an integral part of our planet's health and sustainability. By raising awareness, supporting conservation efforts, and making conscious choices in our daily lives, we can contribute to the preservation of these natural wonders for generations to come.

0,,Sara enters the classroom for the first time the next morning, and everyone checks her out because she's the new kid. Some of her classmates include: Lavinia Herbert and Lottie Leigh . Talk about multi-age classrooms. All the girls have been gossiping about Sara: she has a French maid and boxes full of ridiculously frilly clothes, canyouevenbelieveit? Oh, and she's been telling tales about how she believes that dolls can talk and walk but only do it when people are out of the room. Who is this girl? Miss Minchin introduces Sara to the rest of the class and tells her that she will be studying French. Sara wants to say that she already knows French, but she doesn't know how to say so and ends up giving Miss Minchin the impression that she's being difficult and doesn't want to learn the language. When the French master, Monsieur Dufarge comes in, Miss Minchin announces to him that Sara does not wish to learn French. However, Sara stands up and begins to explain to Monsieur Dufarge--in perfect French, of course--that she totally does know French, merci beaucoup. Miss Minchin has a secret: she doesn't speak French. So now she's ticked off that Sara didn't tell her, annoyed that she knows she's in the wrong, and also a little resentful of her new pupil. Yeah, this is going to end well.
1,,Miss Minchin kisses up to Sara all the time and compliments her because she wants her to stay at the boarding school--on account of all that money, of course. Whenever parents come, Sara is brought out to speak to them as evidence of how good the school is. That's bananas, of course, since Sara hasn't learned a thing at the school. Lavinia is super jealous of Sara, Mean Girls-style. She wants to stay the queen bee and thinks that Sara's habit of playing pretend and making up stories is completely silly. However, Sara is super friendly and kind to all the students so obviously they like her more. She even has tea parties for them in her room. One little girl, Lottie Leigh, is prone to tantrums and constantly uses the fact that her mother is dead as a bargaining chip. One day when she's having a tantrum that Miss Amelia and Miss Minchin can't deal with, Sara volunteers to to calm her down. Sara lets her cry and then calmly informs Lottie that she doesn't have a mother either. Both their mothers are in heaven and that it is an absolutely beautiful and angelic place. Sara says that she will be Lottie's mama at the school, and takes her to go wash her face and brush her hair.
2,,Sara tells the children in the Large Family all about her story, which they love--especially the part about the magical things that appeared in her attic room. Mr. Carrisford tells his part of the story and says that Ram Dass thought of the idea of sneaking over to Sara's room and making it magical and warm--and that Mr. Carrisford loved how fanciful the idea was. They become great friends, Sara and Mr. Carrisford. He plans all sorts of fun activities, gives her little gifts, and even buys her a dog named Boris. One day, Sara looks thoughtful and Mr. Carrisford asks her what she's thinking about. She says she's thinking about "the hungry day" when she found the fourpence and bought the buns. She wants to go talk to the baker and ask her if she'll give bread to the poor children and send the bill to Sara. The next morning, Sara and Mr. Carrisford and Becky set out to go to the bakery, and Sara has to remind the baker woman about who she is. Then Sara asks her if she'll give food to the hungry children and let Sara pay for it. When the baker woman hears this, she says that she's already doing a bit of that. Oh, and she took in that hungry child that Sara gave the five buns. The girl now works at the bakery. Sara says that because Anne knows what it's like to be hungry, that she should be the one to give the buns and bread to the children in the future. And ... that's all, folks. Happy endings all around.
3,,Scene One Titania and Bottom, still with an asses head, enter the stage followed by Titania's fairies. Bottom asks the fairies to scratch his head, and is hungry for some hay. Titania, completely in love with him, orders the fairies to find him food. Together they soon fall asleep. Oberon enters and looks at his sleeping Queen. He tells the puck that Titania gave him her young boy earlier in the woods, and so it is time for him to remove the spell from her eyes. He orders Robin to change Bottom back to normal, but first he wakes up Titania. She at first thinks she dreamed about being in love with an ass, but then sees Bottom still asleep by her side. Oberon helps her off the ground and tells her that tomorrow they will dance at the weddings of Theseus and the other two couples. Theseus, Hippolyta and Egeus arrive where the lovers are sleeping. They are in the woods to celebrate the May morning with hunting hounds in preparation of the day's ceremonies. Theseus sees the lovers and has them woken by sounding the hunting horns. The lovers tell Theseus what they remember from the night before, and Lysander declares his love for Hermia while Demetrius speaks of his love for Helena. Theseus decides to override Egeus' will and have all three of them get married in Athens that day. They eventually all depart for Athens. Bottom wakes up and realizes that he has been abandoned in the woods by his friends. He recalls what happened to him only as a dream, a dream about which he says, "I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called 'Bottom's Dream' . Bottom then returns to Athens. Act Four, Scene Two The artisans are lamenting the fact that the Duke Theseus is already married, as well as the other noblemen, which means they missed their chance to perform Pyramus and Thisbe at the wedding. Bottom finally arrives and tells the men to hurry to the festivities since there is still enough time to perform the play.
4,,Titania instructs her fairies to dance and sing her to sleep. Afterwards, her attendants can go back to their fairy work and disappear. Oberon slips in and manages to get the pansy juice onto Titania eyes before running off. Lysander and Hermia come tripping in after Oberon exits. They're lost so they decide to stop for the night and rest. Lysander wants to sleep close to Hermia but she tells him to back off because they're not married yet. Lysander tries to sweet-talk Hermia but she's not having it. They fall asleep separately. Puck ambles onto the stage. Puck thinks Lysander is Demetrius and sprinkles the love juice on his eyelids. Puck runs off to tell Oberon. Then Demetrius runs onto the stage with Helena chasing after him. Demetrius tells her to scram but she refuses. Demetrius exits the stage, leaving Helena to roam around on her own. Helena, finally weary of running after Demetrius, wanders alone for a bit, talking to herself about how poorly she measures up to Hermia. Hermia's eyes are so much brighter--probably, Helena thinks, because she hasn't spent as much time crying as Helena has. In the middle of her pity party, she notices Lysander on the ground. Worried that he's dead, she shakes him awake. Lysander takes one look at Helena and falls in love at first sight. Then he says he's going to kill Demetrius. Helena is confused and thinks Lysander is mocking her, which adds to the indignity of Demetrius not loving her. She exits, certain that she's being punked. Lysander says he never wants to see Hermia again and deserts her while she's sleeping. Hermia wakes up from a horrible dream. Thinking Lysander is still sleeping near her, she recounts the nightmare: she thought a serpent was eating her heart while Lysander stood by smiling. Hermia then realizes that Lysander's not there. She panics and runs off looking for him, promising she'll either find her love or kill herself.
5,,This scene opens in Theseus' palace in Athens. It is four days before his wedding to Hippolyta, the former queen of the Amazons, and Theseus is impatient with how slowly time is moving. Hippolyta assures him that the wedding day will soon arrive. As Theseus and Hippolyta plan their wedding festivities, Egeus and his daughter, Hermia, arrive on the scene with Lysander and Demetrius. Egeus is angry because his daughter refuses to marry Demetrius, the man of his choice, but is instead in love with Lysander. Egeus accuses Lysander of bewitching his daughter and stealing her love by underhanded means. Agreeing with Egeus, Theseus declares that it is a daughter's duty to obey her father. Hermia demands to know the worst punishment she will receive for disobedience. Death or spending her life in a nunnery comprise Hermia's choices. Lysander joins the argument, arguing that he is Demetrius' equal in everything and is, indeed, more constant in his affection than Demetrius, who was recently in love with Helena. These proceedings upset Hippolyta, because the prospect of Hermia's death upsets her plans for a happy, festive wedding day. Finally, everyone except Lysander and Hermia leave the stage. Lysander reminds Hermia that the course of true love has never run smoothly, so they must view their difficulties as typical for lovers. He has a plan for eluding Athenian law: The two lovers will run away from Athens and live with his childless widow aunt to whom he has always been a surrogate son. Living with her, they will be outside of Athenian jurisdiction so that Hermia can avoid Theseus' death sentence and can marry. Having few other options, Hermia is enthusiastic about Lysander's idea and declares her undying love for him. Just as the lovers have completed their plan for escape, Helena enters the scene. What charms does Hermia possess, Helena wonders, that have so completely captivated Demetrius? Hermia swears that she has no interest in Demetrius, that he actually seems to thrive on her hatred of him. Hermia and Lysander confess their intention of fleeing Athens, and Helena decides to tell Demetrius about it in a final attempt to win his love.
6,,This scene transports its viewers from Athens into the woods outside of the city, the dwelling place of Oberon, Titania, and their band of fairies. The scene begins with a conversation between Oberon's mischievous elf Robin Goodfellow, also known as Puck, and one of Titania's attendants. Puck warns her to keep Titania away from this part of the woods because Oberon will be reveling here, and if the two meet there will certainly be a serious quarrel. Oberon is angry with Titania because she refuses to give him a sweet Indian boy upon whom she dotes. Titania's attendant suddenly recognizes Puck, accusing him of being the hobgoblin who is blamed for roguish acts in the village, such as frightening young women or misleading night travelers. Puck admits that he is this "merry wanderer of the night." Suddenly Oberon and Titania enter the scene from opposite directions. Their bickering begins. Each accuses the other of having had affairs, and Titania says Oberon's persecution of her has caused the current chaos in the world: The rivers are flooding, the corn is rotting, and people are plagued by "rheumatic" diseases. Oberon blames Titania; if she would simply relinquish the Indian boy, peace would be restored. Titania refuses to let the boy go because his mother was a close friend of hers, and when she died in childbirth, Titania agreed to raise her son. Hatching a plan to win the Indian boy, Oberon sends Puck in search of a flower called love-in-idleness. When the juice of this magical flower is poured on sleepers' eyelids, it makes them dote crazily on the first live creature they see upon awakening. In this way, Oberon plans to make Titania fall in love with some wild beast; he won't release her from this unpleasant spell until she gives him the Indian boy. After Puck has left in search of the powerful flower, Oberon sits scheming. Demetrius and Helena unknowingly stumble into his bower, but he is invisible to them. Helena actively pursues her beloved, but Demetrius vows to hurt her if she doesn't leave him alone. After they have left, Puck returns. Taking pity on Helena, Oberon tells Puck to anoint the eyes of the Athenian man so that he will fall in love with this jilted woman. Puck promises to fulfill Oberon's order, though Puck hasn't seen Demetrius, so he doesn't know which Athenian Oberon is talking about.
7,,Bottom is enjoying his sojourn in Titania's bower: Peaseblossom amiably scratches his head, while Cobweb goes off in search of honey for him. As Bottom sleeps in Titania's arms, Oberon walks in. Feeling pity for Titania's pitiful love for this ass, Oberon squeezes an herb on her eyes to release her from the spell. Titania awakens, telling Oberon about her strange dream of being in love with an ass. Oberon has Puck remove the ass' head from Bottom. Now that Oberon has won the Indian boy from Titania, he is willing to forget their argument, and the two, reunited, dance off together so they can bless Theseus' marriage. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Egeus are walking through the woods when Theseus suddenly spies the sleeping lovers. Egeus recognizes them but wonders how they ended up together because Demetrius and Lysander are enemies. Theseus imagines they woke early to observe the rite of May and remembers this is the day Hermia needs to make a choice about her future. When the lovers are awakened, Demetrius confesses that he now loves Helena. No one really understands what has happened. Theseus decides the lovers should be married along with him and Hippolyta. As the lovers return to the palace, the scene shifts to Bottom. Just awakening from his dream, Bottom declares he'll have Quince write a ballad about it, called "Bottom's Dream," because it has no bottom.
8,,A group of craftsmen have been instructed to present a play to honor Duke Theseus on his wedding day. They have decided on the play, "The Most Lamentable Comedy and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe. " As the scene opens, they are assigning the roles. Peter Quince seems to be the natural leader of the group, even though the more humorous Nick Bottom has decided to steal the show. Nick is to play the hero Pyramus, and Francis Flute is to play Thisbe. Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug have also been assigned their roles. The group decides to meet the following night in the nearby woods in order to rehearse the play without interruption.
9,,Titania orders her fairies to sing a song and then proceed with their tasks of gathering canker from the musk-nose buds and making coats for themselves. Also, some of them must keep the roosting owls away so that she can sleep peacefully. As the fairies sing, Titania falls asleep. Oberon enters and squeezes the juices of the magical flower on Titania's eyelids, while pronouncing his charm. Lysander and Hermia enter. They have been wandering in the woods looking for each other and are now tired. Since Lysander is unsure of the way out of the woods in the dark, they decide to sleep here for the night, leaving the next morning. When they fall asleep, Puck enters. He sees Lysander and mistakes him for Demetrius. He carries out Oberon's order by squeezing the juice of the flower on his eyelids and then departs, unaware of his mistake. Demetrius enters, followed by an exhausted Helena. As she laments her sad plight, she sees Lysander lying on the ground. Feeling concerned, she wakes him. The charm pronounced by Puck takes effect, and Lysander professes his love for Helena, who thinks he is teasing her. She bemoans, "Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?" Upset that Lysander should so cruelly abuse her, Helena leaves in a mood of disgust and despair. Lysander bids his final farewell to the sleeping Hermia and follows Helena. When Hermia is awakened by a nightmare, she calls for Lysander; when she realizes he is not close by, she leaves the scene to search for him.
10,,Titania is still under the spell and very much in love with Bottom, who continues to be the bully and enjoys the attention he gets. Oberon, who has been watching the pair from behind, comes forward, followed shortly afterwards by Puck. Oberon tells Puck that after taunting Titania about Bottom, he has asked for the boy and gotten him; "and now I have the boy I will undo / This hateful imperfections of her eyes." Oberon is determined to right all the wrongs done by the fairies, including himself. As a result, he also directs Puck to remove the ass's head from Bottom and let him go back to Athens. When everything is returned to normal, Oberon hopes that everyone will consider the night's incidents as "the fierce vexation of a dream." When Oberon removes the spell from Titania, she wakes and says, "What visions have I seen! / Methought I was enamoured of an ass. " Puck carefully removes the ass's head from Bottom so that Titania will not see it. Oberon calls for music and starts dancing with Titania. Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus, and the others enter the woods to start the celebrations prior to the wedding. Theseus spots the four "lovers," who are asleep. Egeus recognizes them and wonders what brings the four of them together. Theseus, in his happiness, cannot see anything amiss and so concludes that they must have arrived early to join the revelries. He also remembers that this is the day when Hermia is to give her answer about marrying Demetrius. The horns are sounded to wake the lovers. Upon rising, Lysander confesses that he and Hermia had planned to escape "the perils of the Athenian Law" and marry. Egeus is angry and again demands that Hermia marry Demetrius. He then tries to rouse Demetrius against Lysander, who is trying to steal his future wife. Demetrius says that a change has come over him. He is no longer in love with Hermia; Helena is now the object and pleasure of his eye. In the climatic moment of the plot, Theseus tells Egeus, "I will overbear your will" and adds that on the ramp, along with him, "these couples shall eternally be knit. " With the unknown help of the fairies, Theseus rights the wrongs between the two couples so that true love can flourish. When Theseus and his entourage depart for Athens, the two couples are left behind to decipher what has happened the previous night. They are totally confused and not certain whether they are still dreaming or whether the duke and his followers have really been in the woods. They decide to follow the Duke to Athens, and on the way the try to figure last night's "dreams." Bottom, now free of Puck's prank, enters and thinks he has had a strange dream as well. He then remembers the play about Pyramus and decides to request that Peter Quince write a ballad and call it "Bottom's Dream," to be sung at the end of the play.
11,,A group of artisans discuss the play they are going to perform as part of Theseus's wedding celebration. The play is entitled, "The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe." Peter Quince takes a roll call of the actors and hands out their parts. Bottom the weaver gets the leading role of Pyramus, which pleases him because he is super-confident of his acting abilities. He is so confident, in fact, that he wishes to play the part of Thisbe too, which Quince assigns to Flute the bellows-mender. Bottom also wants to play the lion, and promises to delight everyone with his roar. But the part goes to the timid Snug the joiner. Quince tells the men to learn their parts by the following night, and to meet for a rehearsal in the wood by moonlight.
12,,Titania bids her fairies sing her a lullaby, which sends her asleep. The fairies depart, and Oberon enters and squeezes the juice on Titania's eyelids. He tells her to awaken when some vile thing is near. Lysander and Hermia enter. They are lost, and decide to rest. Hermia insists that Lysander lie down some distance away from her, to ensure her chastity. They both sleep. Puck enters, and mistakes Lysander for Demetrius. He puts some of the flower-juice on Lysander's eyelids. Demetrius enters, with Helena chasing him. He tells her to leave him alone, and goes off on his own. Helena comes upon the sleeping Lysander and wakes him up. As soon as Lysander opens his eyes he falls wildly in love with Helena and wants to kill Demetrius. He regrets all the time he spent with Hermia; Helena is much more worthy of his love. Helena, bewildered, can only assume that Lysander is making fun of her, and protests that she does not deserve to be mocked. She exits, upset and confused. Lysander turns to the sleeping Hermia and says that he now loathes her, and has eyes only for Helena. He goes off to find her. Hermia wakes with a start, calling for Lysander to help her. She says she dreamt a serpent was eating away at her heart, while Lysander sat by smiling. On finding that Lysander has gone, she is terrified at being alone in the wood.
13,,Back in Athens, Quince, Flute, Snout and Starveling are desperate to find Bottom. If he cannot be located, they will have to cancel their play. Snug enters, with the news that the Duke has just left the Temple with several lords and ladies who have just been married. He regrets that their play is not going to happen, for it would have brought them the favor of the Duke. Bottom suddenly enters and says he has a wonderful story to tell them . . . but he will keep it for later. He urges them all to get prepared immediately to perform their play.
14,,While having tea with Mrs. Butterworth, Mrs. Honeychurch, and Cecil, Lucy keeps thinking about her reunion with George; nothing went as she had planned. Although she had rehearsed the meeting many times, she was not prepared for a boisterous, cheerful, and naked man. She did not feel in control of the situation. Mrs. Butterworth is kindly, simple, and devoted to the unsophisticated world of affluent country people. Cecil cannot stand her, and it shows. When Cecil and the Honeychurch women go home, Mrs. Honeychurch talks to Lucy about Cecil's behavior. Although Lucy defends Cecil, his behavior angers Mrs. Honeychurch. Lucy tries to change the subject by bringing up the letter she received from Charlotte, but the conversation blows up into a heated discussion of Cecil's snobbery in general. Mrs. Honeychurch dislikes his treatment of their family and friends, and she can see no justification for it. On the way to her room, Lucy runs into Freddy. He likes the Emersons, and he wants to invite them for Sunday tea. She advises against it, but he seems set on the idea. Mrs. Honeychurch asks about Charlotte's letter, and if she mentioned her boiler. Lucy says she cannot keep track of Charlotte's problems, especially now that Mrs. Honeychurch does not like Cecil. Mrs. Honeychurch does not get angry but instead instructs her daughter to give her a kiss. With this gesture, everything is good again between them. During dinner, all goes well until Freddy asks about the Emersons. Lucy manages to change the subject. But Mrs. Honeychurch brings up the possibility of having Charlotte come to visit Windy Corner, because the boiler at her place is broken. Lucy protests, and Cecil seconds her. But Mrs. Honeychurch is adamant, and she expresses her disapproval of their unkindness. But Lucy cannot help it; she does not like Charlotte, and nothing has ever come of being kind to her. She thinks fearfully of the upcoming Sunday: George, Charlotte, and Cecil will all be at Windy Corner.
15,,Lucy tries to suppress her feelings. She thinks that she must at all costs rid herself of George and maintain her engagement to Cecil. She calls for Charlotte, and confronts her with the events of the novel. Lucy has correctly deduced that Charlotte must have told Miss Lavish about the kiss in Florence. Now, it becomes clear why Charlotte initially made Lucy promise not to tell anyone but later so adamantly insisted that Lucy should tell everyone. Charlotte told Miss Lavish and feared that the woman would prove indiscreet. Lucy hopes that Charlotte will step in and confront George, as she did in Florence, but Charlotte hems and haws until it becomes clear that it is up to Lucy. She asks Charlotte to be present while she does it. She tells George, with Charlotte in the room, that he can never enter the house again. George argues passionately with her: he tells her that he would not have tried anything if Cecil were a different man. But Cecil is abominable, good for talk of books and painting but not much else. He is unkind and "should know no one intimately, least of all a woman". George pegged him as awful from the first day they met. He is always telling Lucy how to think, and what to be shocked by. Lucy responds that George is now doing the same thing. George admits that all men have some level of brutishness in them, and he has difficulty suppressing certain instincts, but he promises that he loves her in a deeper and more respectful way than Cecil does. Men and women will have to fight these attitudes together. They continue to argue, with George's pleas becoming more desperate. When it becomes clear that Lucy will not be moved, he leaves in despair. Charlotte commends Lucy for her courage. Lucy and Charlotte go back outside. She is suddenly aware that it is autumn, and she realizes that time is passing. She is seized by emotions she cannot articulate. Freddy wishes to play doubles again. With George gone, they need a fourth. Freddy asks Cecil, and Cecil refuses with pomp. Lucy's reaction is sudden: "The scales fell from Lucy's eyes. How had she stood Cecil for a moment. He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement".
16,,Cecil is horribly hurt, and he wants explanations. Lucy eludes him as long as she can, but finally she tells him many of the things that George has helped her to realize. Cecil is selfish, condescending, and cruel to other human beings. He is barbaric to women, and will not respect Lucy enough to let her decide how to think and act. None of the art or books he has studied has helped him to be better to other people. Cecil is floored; he concedes that she is right. He is more in love with her than ever. When he says that she speaks with a new voice, he means that she seems more herself than he has ever seen; she mistakes his meaning and thinks he is accusing her of being in love with someone else. She becomes very defensive, but he assures her that he intended no such meaning. They part, Cecil full of new respect for Lucy. Lucy resolves never to marry. She will become a lone woman; she must forget that George ever loved her. She has lied to both Cecil and George, and she must now stick with the lie. She will stay with her choice. The narrator condemns her choice, calling it a sin against passion and truth. Forster writes, "The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before".
17,,Lucy is left to face the situation bravely. She has seen George Emerson again. His voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him, but rather than recognize that she is in love with him, Lucy tells herself it is a trick of the nerves. The house is full: Charlotte has arrived and is quickly on everyone's nerves; Minnie Beebe is staying with the family because of a diphteria epidemic; and Freddy has a friend, Mr. Floyd, staying there as well. Charlotte confronts Lucy, again urging her to tell about George, lest Cecil hear it from some other source. Lucy convinces Charlotte that George is all right and not in love with her. her speech to Charlotte, however, she makes a slip that indicates it was she, not George, who lost her head when she saw him against a beautiful view
18,,Cecil is bewildered and hurt, and Lucy tries to explain her feelings. As Lucy asserts herself, it seems to Cecil that she has changed from a Leonardo painting to a living woman and become even more real and desirable. He exclaims that he loves her and presses her to tell why she doesn't love him. Lucy repeats to him the phrases that George used: "you're the sort who can't know any one intimately. you're always protecting me. I won't be protected. I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right. This is the crux of the reason why she cannot be with Cecil: he cannot view her as an equal; he wants to stifle her. Cecil realizes in a rush of insight that she is right about him and admires her more than ever. She insists that there is no one else, and he believes her. Having lied to both George and Cecil, Lucy decides that she will never marry. She will live her life alone, a decision that Miss Bartlett made thirty years before. The narrator makes clear that by making this decision, she is sinning against love and entering a period of darkness
19,,Lucy is unhappy with the way her reunion with George went off. She had rehearsed the moment over and over in her mind but, as she observes, these things rarely turn out the way we plan them to. As Lucy ponders this dilemma, she is with Mrs. Honeychurch and Cecil, visiting an old friend, Mrs. Butterworth. Cecil hates visits like this, and makes himself quite difficult. On returning to Windy Corner, Mrs. Honeychurch reveals to Lucy that she's not Cecil's biggest fan - he's always being rude to people he doesn't like , and constantly stops the Honeychurches from having fun. He doesn't even like it when Freddy sings funny songs, which sounds pretty enjoyable to us. What a spoilsport. Lucy is confused by the clash of Cecil-world and Honeychurch-world, and it puts her in a bad mood. Freddy unfortuitously chooses this moment to come up and ask her about George, whom he likes tremendously. He intends to invite the Emersons over for tennis on Sunday. Mrs. Honeychurch mentions Charlotte, who apparently is having troubles with her hot water boiler. This is the absolute last thing Lucy wants to hear, and she almost blows her top. Fortunately, her mother notices and calms her down. Emotional crisis averted, the family sits down to dinner. Freddy brings up George again, but Lucy distracts everyone by bringing up Miss Lavish - it turns out that Mrs. Honeychurch hates woman novelists. But talk of writing women can't last forever, and the conversation eventually turns back down the disastrous path it came from. Mrs. Honeychurch proposes something terrible - she plans to ask Charlotte to come and stay, since she's having her house's plumbing fixed. Lucy and Cecil are opposed to this plan, but Freddy, who's always willing to see the best in people, feebly defends Charlotte. We learn that there will be many visitors in the next week, which should be exciting... The "ghosts" of Lucy's tormented memories are everywhere - everything is changing for her, and even the places of her childhood are being overtaken by images of George and of Italy. It's decided that Charlotte will come next week. Cecil abruptly concludes the chapter by rudely asking if he and Lucy can leave the dinner table.
20,,Lucy realizes that Charlotte told Miss Lavish about the kiss, and confronts her cousin about it. Charlotte, embarrassed and upset, admits that she did. Lucy tells her about Kiss #2, then asks Charlotte for help talking to George. This time, though, Charlotte lamely backs out - feeling helpless and exposed, she asks Lucy to do it herself. George comes in soon enough, and though Lucy attempts to send him away, he stays. Impassioned, he clearly outlines all of the reasons Lucy can't marry Cecil . George ends by declaring his love for Lucy, which, he's certain, is "better" and more sincere than Cecil's love for her. He even appeals to Charlotte for assistance, and is met with silence. Thus rejected, he leaves. Lucy and Charlotte give the situation a short debriefing, then attempt to go about their business. Lucy, however, is plagued by what George said about Cecil. She realizes that she's been blind all along, and breaks off her engagement.
21,,This chapter details the somewhat awkward breakup of Lucy and Cecil. Surprisingly, Cecil takes it well. So well, in fact, that Lucy is irritated. Lucy allows herself to get upset, and, seeking an argument, attacks Cecil's attitude and opinions directly. At this last desperate moment, he actually feels something real and legitimate for Lucy - but it's too late. Lucy repeats George's anti-Cecil argument to Cecil himself, almost word for word. He is awestruck. Cecil finally realizes that his approach to Lucy and to women in general has been wrong all along. He apologizes for the wrongs he's done to her, then says that it's as though a new voice is speaking through her tonight. He's actually right - it's George's voice. Lucy is hyper-sensitive to this fact, and she immediately thinks he's accusing her of finding another man. She jumps down Cecil's throat and he apologizes. They calm down as much as possible and part civilly, even tenderly. Lucy, watching Cecil walk away, swears never to marry. The narrator ominously comments that Lucy has joined the ranks of those who deny themselves their true feelings...like Charlotte Bartlett.
22,,Watson and Holmes left Lauriston Gardens around 1pm; Holmes mailed a telegram and the two men drove to the home of John Rance. Along the way Holmes explained to Watson how he had observed the multiple horses' hooves, the height of the murderer, and his age. He also offered the fact that he knew the writing on the wall was done with the man's forefinger dipped in blood, and the ash from the cigar was clearly a Trichinolopy brand because of the nature of the ash. The florid face was more of a gamble, but Holmes did not tell Watson why he believed that to be the case. Watson summed up his confusion at the mysteriousness of the case- why the men were in an empty house?, what happened to their hansom driver?, what was the motive of the murderer?, why was there a wedding ring?, and what did the word RACHE mean?. Holmes approved of Watson's summation, and first answered that the word on the wall was merely a blind to mislead the police. He did not want to add much further, because "you know a conjurer gets no credit once he has explained his trick; and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all." Watson rejoined that Holmes was responsible for bringing the act of detection as close to an exact science a he had ever seen, and Holmes smiled with pride at the flattering words. The driver stopped at Audley Court where John Rance lived; it was a sordid and unpleasing street. The constable looked irritated at being interrupted from his sleep at first, but soon warmed to the two men when Holmes gave him a coin. The constable started from the beginning of the tale, explaining that he was on the late shift and it was very quiet except for a bar fight earlier. It began to rain and he stood with his fellow constable, Harry Murcher, for awhile on a corner. He then decided to look around Brixton Road and observed a light on in the empty house. Holmes noted that he had walked up to the house and then walked back to the gate; this bit of information shocked the constable, who had no idea how Holmes knew that. Rance said he wanted to see if Murcher was around so he would not have to go into the house alone. The latter was not, so Rance went inside anyway. The house was empty and the candle was flickering on the mantle. Holmes continued to surprise Rance with his insertions of how exactly Rance traversed the room. After Rance saw the body he went outside and sounded his whistle and Murcher and two others appeared. The only other thing he noted was a very drunk man stumbling about; he did not arrest him due to the dead body, a much more important manner. Holmes was curious about this drunken man and asked further questions. Rance said he had a red face and a long heavy overcoat. Holmes asked if he had a whip in his hand and Rance said no, upon which Holmes muttered that he must have dropped it. As Holmes rose to leave he commented to Rance that he would never rise in the ranks of the force because he had no real powers of observation- "The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the key to this mystery, and whom we are seeking." Watson and Holmes left, Holmes angrily muttering about how Rance was a fool and missed that piece of luck. Watson wondered aloud why the man would hang around the house where the murder was committed, and Holmes clarified that it was because he had come back for the ring. He then thanked Watson for encouraging him to follow up this "study in scarlet;" he deemed it such because "there's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colorless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."
23,,When Holmes and Watson returned to the house, Watson laid down to take a nap as his mind was tumultuous after the events of the morning. He meditated on the grotesque visage of the dead man and almost thanked the murderer for ridding the world of such a clearly malignant man. Of course, he did recognize that "justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law." Watson thought more of the poison which killed Drebber, and remembered that Holmes had sniffed the man's mouth. Holmes' "quiet, self-confident manner" was comforting, however, and Watson looked forward to hearing about his conjectures after he returned from a concert. When Holmes came in he expressed his feelings that music was perhaps so moving because the human capacity to produce and appreciate music existed even before speech. Watson confessed he was shaken by the events of the morning, even more so than his experiences in Afghanistan. Holmes agreed that this was understandable since "where there is no imagination there is no horror." Changing the subject, Holmes told Watson that he had placed an advertisement in the paper for the lost ring and told any claimants to come to the apartments between eight and nine that evening. Holmes had a facsimile ring ready, and was confident that the man who showed up would be the murderer. It was clear that "this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring," and had pretended to be drunk when he returned to the street where he murdered Drebber and saw the policemen there. He might believe he lost the ring in the road and would be pleased to see the advertisement in the paper. There would be no reason to expect a trap. Watson would meet with the man, keeping a pistol with him since the man would no doubt be desperate. Holmes took up his violin for a few minutes, and confided to Watson that he'd had a response to his American telegram and that his view of the case was the correct one. The doorbell rang and the servant opened it; the two men heard a "clear but rather harsh" voice downstairs but were remarkably surprised when the owner of the voice turned out to be an old woman, not the violent murderer they'd expected! The woman explained that the ring belonged to her girl Sally, who had recently married a Tom Dennis, a steward aboard a Union boat, and had lost her wedding ring the last night. Holmes indicated to Watson to give her the ring, and the two men wished her well. After she departed, Holmes announced that he would follow her because she was clearly an accomplice and might lead him to the murderer. Watson waited up for Holmes, perusing a book since he could not sleep. When Holmes returned his facial expression was a mixture of "amusement and chagrin," but the former won out and he began to laugh. He told how he had followed the woman on foot for a while, and then jumped on the back of her cab when she hailed one to take her the rest of the way. When the cab stopped and Holmes jumped off, he heard the driver exclaim in anger because there was no longer anyone in the cab. The woman had jumped out at some point, aware that she was being followed. Watson marveled that an old woman could elude Holmes like that, but Holmes exclaimed "Old woman be damned! We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was imitable." The man knew he was being followed and "gave me the slip." This proved that the murderer was not completely a solitary figure because he had friends who were willing to risk a lot for him. After this tale Holmes remarked that Watson was looking tired, and encouraged him to go to bed. Watson agreed and turned in, but heard Holmes playing his violin late into the night as he tried to unravel the mystery.
24,,Jefferson Hope's aneurism burst that evening; he was found in his cell, dead, with a placid expression upon his face. After a few pensive moments following the news, Holmes brightened and commenced explaining to Watson how he had put the pieces of the case together and found the murderer within three days. His skill centered upon being able to reason backwards rather than look at a chain of events and predict what they would lead to. The latter was a common skill but reasoning backwards was very rare and quite useful indeed. In this case Holmes put this strategy to effect. When Holmes first arrived at the murder scene he noted the marks of a cab and deduced that it was there during the night. The footsteps in the yard revealed two men -one that was very tall and one that was fashionably dressed . Inside, the well-dressed one was found dead. Holmes smelled poison upon him and saw that his contorted face was a result of the poison. This crime was not committed for robbery, so it must have been political or for a woman. Political motivation was soon dropped, for "political assassins are glad to do their work and then fly." This must have been a private matter, not a public one. The word in blood on the wall was no doubt a blind. The ring of course answered the question, especially when Holmes learned the man came back for it. Looking around the room at the clues Holmes learned more about the murderer. After he left he telephoned Cleveland and asked about a marriage of Enoch Drebber. He learned that Drebber had once invoked the protection of the law against a Jefferson Hope, a "rival in love" who was now in Europe as well. The man in the cab was no doubt Jefferson Hope; being a cab driver was an excellent way to follow someone in London. Hope would not want to draw attention to himself by leaving his profession right away, so he would continue to drive the cab for a few days. Holmes sent his street urchin gang to every cab proprietor in London until he found the one Hope worked for. The murder of Stangerson was unforeseen, but could hardly have been prevented. Through that he came into contact with the pills. Watson warmly lauded Holmes for his detective prowess and encouraged him to publish an account of the case. Holmes told Watson he could do as he pleased and handed him the paper. In it was a paragraph about the case they had just solved. The paper lamented that the true facts of the case may never be known because of Hope's death, but that "we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old-standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part." It said Lestrade and Gregson were responsible for the capture, and that an amateur named Sherlock Holmes helped and might someday "attain to some degree of their skill." Holmes laughed at that, and reminded Watson of when they started this whole affair he had warned him of this -"that's the result of all our Study in Scarlet; to get them a testimonial!" Watson told him that he had all of the facts in his journal and would make them known to the public. In the meantime he should remember the Latin words of the Roman miser that said "the public hiss at me, but I cheer myself when in my own house I contemplate the coins in my strong-box."
25,,The Mail Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a confidential clerk at Tellson's Bank of London, is on his way to Dover in a mail-coach. It is a cold night and he is wrapped up to the ears, so his physical appearance is concealed from his fellow-passengers, all of whom are strangers. The coachman fears his passengers just as they fear one another, since highway robberies are exceedingly common and any of them could be in league with robbers. So when he hears a horse galloping towards the coach on the road, he becomes fearful. Jerry Cruncher, the rider of the horse, asks for Mr. Lorry, giving him a paper message to wait at Dover for a young lady. Mr. Lorry's cryptic reply is, "recalled to life. After this exchange, Mr. Lorry gets back in the coach, which continues to Dover. Jerry pauses and reflects on the long, hard gallop he had from London and muses to himself that he has been given a very strange message
26,,Five Years Later The second book opens with a description of the venerable Tellson's Bank. Its darkness and discomfort are much beloved by those who work there. Indeed, their conviction that it should remain inconvenient and deteriorating is so strong that they would have disinherited a son who disagreed with them. Jerry Cruncher, who delivered the message on horseback to Mr. Lorry, serves as an odd job man for Tellson's. He lives in Whitefriars in a tiny apartment kept immaculate by his wife. He abuses this wife roundly for kneeling to pray, insinuating that her prayers interfere with the success of his business. He enlists the aid of his admiring son to prevent Mrs. Cruncher from praying against him. When she tries to pray, her son reveals her transgression to his father. The young Cruncher follows his father to work, and he wonders where the rust on the straw his father is chewing comes from. His job at Tellson's does not involve rust, yet Jerry Cruncher is always rusty
27,,The Jackal Mr. Stryver is prone to alcoholism, and he is a drinking companion of Mr. Carton's--they had been fellow students in Paris. Mr. Stryver, despite all of his capacity to push himself ahead, became a much more successful lawyer when Mr. Carton began working on and helping summarize his documents for him. Thus Carton became Stryver's jackal. When Stryver talks about how pretty Miss Manette is, Carton denies it, claiming she is nothing but a blond "doll. Carton leaves Stryver's house and returns to his own, crying himself to sleep. He is haunted by the honorable glories that once were available to him but are now out of his reach
28,,Two Promises A year later, Charles Darnay is back in England, happily working as a tutor of French. He has been in love with Lucie since he met her, and he finally asks her father for permission to make his feelings known to her. Despite Dr. Manette's hesitations, Darnay convinces him that his intentions are honorable and sincere. He does not wish to come between Lucie and her father; he wishes, if possible, to bind them closer. There is always a touch of reserve in Dr. Manette's reception of Darnay, and this struggle is evident in his expression of dread, and although he gives his blessing to Darnay, something is not quite right. Darnay tells the doctor that he is using an assumed name and tries to tell him why he is in England and what his real name is, but the doctor stops him. He says that if Charles does marry Lucie, he should tell him these secrets on the marriage morning. When Lucie returns to the house that night, she hears him working on his shoemaking again for the first time since Paris and is very distressed. She knocks on his door and he stops
29,,The Fellow of Delicacy On his way to Lucie's house in Soho to declare his intentions, Mr. Stryver passes Tellson's and decides to step inside to ask Mr. Lorry's opinion of the matter. Mr. Lorry expresses some politic confusion, and Stryver asks what could possibly be wrong with his proposal. After all, he is eligible, prosperous, and advancing. He considers that if Lucie recognized these qualities and turned him down, she would be a fool. Despite the fact that he is at Tellson's and must act properly, Mr. Lorry grows angry at this disparagement of Lucie. Mr. Lorry suggests that because it might be painful for Stryver, the doctor, and Lucie if the former were to make an unwelcome suit, perhaps Lorry himself should go to Soho and feel out the subject. Mr. Stryver agrees. When Mr. Lorry arrives at Stryver's house later that evening with a confirmation that a proposal would be unwelcome, he gets a strange response from the would-be suitor. Stryver pretends to have forgotten the subject. When he is reminded, he professes to be sorry for both the doctor and Mr. Lorry, insinuating that Lucie has gotten herself into trouble and is no longer fit to be engaged. Lorry is so surprised that he merely leaves
30,,The Fellow of No Delicacy Mr. Carton had never spoken well or made himself agreeable at the Manette household, but he used to haunt their street at night, dreaming of Lucie. One day he visits her and she asks him what the matter is. He claims that he is beyond help in his profligate ways, but he says his familiarity with the Manettes' family scene has given him the desire to be a good man again. Lucie tries to convince him that this is a possibility, but Carton declares that it is only a dream, however happy. He merely wants to open his heart to her and have her remember that he did so. Before he leaves he promises that he would do anything for her or for anyone close to her
31,,Nine Days Everyone is happy on the wedding day, with the exception of Miss Pross, who still thinks that her brother, Solomon, should have been the groom. Mr. Lorry flirts with Miss Pross, reflecting that perhaps he made a mistake by being a bachelor. Charles Darnay reveals his identity to Doctor Manette, who looks quite white afterward, but the marriage goes ahead. The couple marries and goes on a honeymoon to Wales for nine days, leaving Doctor Manette without his daughter for the first time since he was rescued from Paris. As soon as Lucie leaves, a change comes over her father, and he reverts to his shoemaking and does not recognize Miss Pross. Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross decide to not notify his daughter of the change in her father, and they watch him at night by turns
32,,A Plea When the Darnays return from their honeymoon, the first person to greet them is Sydney Carton. He takes Charles aside and asks him to forget the fact that he ever said that he didn't like him. Charles assures him that it was enough that Sydney saved his life at the trial, and he gives Carton the privilege of coming back and forth to the Soho house whenever he likes. Carton leaves. Darnay speaks generally of the conversation at dinner, remarking on what an odd and dissolute character he is. Darnay means no harm and is only speaking the truth, but later that night Lucie implores him not to speak of Carton in that way but to feel some sympathy for him, which Darnay readily agrees to do
33,,Fire Rises Saint Antoine is a changed place without Monseigneur, as France is a changed place without people of his class. Although he was source of oppression, he was also a source of pride and a symbol of luxury. Two "Jacques" figures greet each other in the countryside. One explains that he has been walking for two straight days and asks the road-mender to wake him when he is done working. The road-mender is fascinated with him and examines him while he sleeps. He wakes him at the appointed hour, and they both go into town. Monsieur Gabelle grows nervous because they are all looking into the sky, and he also looks. The chateau where Monseigneur had lived is on fire. The villagers watch the fire without offering to help put it out, and they follow Monsieur Gabelle to his house to persecute him for being connected with tax collection. Gabelle locks himself in his house and resolves that, if attacked, he will jump off his own roof and crush some of the men below. The mob sets fire to other chateaux belonging to noblemen and hangs functionaries who are less fortunate than Gabelle, but Gabelle escapes
34,,The Shadow Mr. Lorry worries that he is endangering Tellson's Bank by housing the wife of an emigrant prisoner, Lucie, in their lodgings. After shrewdly deciding not to ask Defarge for advice for fear that he might be wrapped up in the revolution, he finds Lucie, her daughter, the Doctor, and Miss Pross a suitable apartment near his own. Jerry Cruncher, whom Mr. Lorry brought with him as a bodyguard, now guards their house. Mr. Lorry returns to his own lodgings, where he is visited by Monsieur Defarge with a message from Doctor Manette, who says that Darnay is safe, but that neither of them can leave prison yet. Defarge also carries a message for Lucie, and Mr. Lorry accompanies him to her new apartment. They are joined in the street by Madame Defarge, whom Mr. Lorry recognizes by her knitting. Lucie is overjoyed to receive her husband's message that he is safe for the time being and that her father has influence. She kisses Madame Defarge's hand in thanks, but the woman does not respond. Mr. Lorry explains that Madame Defarge wants to see the whole family so she knows who to protect during uprisings in the street. Lucie begs her to help her husband if at all possible, but Madame Defarge says that after the poverty and suffering she has seen, the troubles of one woman mean little to her
35,,The Wood-Sawyer Lucie is unsure for one year and three months whether her husband has been alive or dead. She establishes a routine in their new home, and she keeps herself hopeful by setting aside a chair or books for her husband and otherwise behaving as if he lived there, too. Her father informs her that there is a place that she can stand on the sidewalk during certain hours which is overlooked by a window in the prison which her husband may sometimes look out. Lucie faithfully walks back and forth on that sidewalk for two hours each day. Jacques Four has now become a wood-sawyer and has a shack to cut wood near where Lucie walks. He notices that she is there every day, and he mocks her for knowing someone in the prison, pretending to guillotine the whole family with his saw. During December, a crowd of five hundred including Jacques Four and the Vengeance descend on Lucie while she is walking near the prison. She is frightened, but her father reassures her that they will not harm her. Madame Defarge walks by and salutes them. Charles is summoned to appear in court the next day
36,,Our friendly narrator sets the scene: it's a Friday night in November. We're on the Dover road. This should spark some bells for anyone who spent the summer traveling around Europe. Long, long ago, in the years before the Chunnel was built, people who wanted to travel to France took a boat from Dover to Calais. Based on this information, we're guessing that we're about to see some traveling going on. It's just a hunch. Anyhow, we zoom in on a guy who's supposed to be traveling by mail coach to Dover. A mail coach is a coach that, well, carries mail. And people. It's drawn by horses. We say that he's supposed to be in the coach because, at the moment, he's walking in the mud alongside it. In fact, all of the passengers on the coach are walking beside it. In the mud. And no one's all that happy about it. The horses, you see, have gotten bogged down in the mud. Since this is long before the time of cars , the passengers don't have any choice but to hop out and walk. Besides being muddy, it's cold and foggy and altogether disgusting. The longer we think about it, the less we understand why anybody would want to travel to Dover at all. Finally, the coachman manages to push the horses up to the top of the muddy hill. By the time they climb up it, it's almost 10:00. All of a sudden, the coachman hears horses' hooves pounding in the distance. A rider is following them! Everyone stops and listens as a horse draws up to the carriage. The rider of the horse asks for Mr. Jarvis Lorry. A small man answers. He seems to think that the rider's name is Jerry. As it turns out, this is because the rider's name is Jerry. We're starting to trust this Mr. Lorry already. Jerry gives Mr. Lorry a letter. All of the other passengers eye Jerry suspiciously. Now that Mr. Lorry's got a letter from Jerry, they eye him suspiciously, too. Mr. Lorry assures Joe that there's nothing wrong. He is from Tellson's Bank in London. Mentioning the name of Tellson's seems to do the trick. All of a sudden, everyone trusts Mr. Lorry. He reads the note that Jerry handed to him, and tells Jerry to ride back to London to deliver one message: "Recalled to Life." Sound interesting? Just wait. It is! The coach starts off again . As it travels, Joe remarks to Tom that the message Mr. Lorry gave to Jerry was rather cryptic. Tom agrees. They puzzle over it for the rest of the journey.
37,,Let's all start with some philosophical reflections, shall we? If you really think about it, do you actually know the people around you? Do you really? If not, where does that leave you? Sad and lonely? Exactly. Our narrator starts out this chapter with some cheerful reflections. You don't know the people you love. Not really. Hey, we don't know the people we love. Every man is an island. It's all very existential. Actually, it's all very good writing, as well. We totally recommend that you check it out. It's only about a paragraph long. The synopsis, though, is this: death sucks so badly because it forces us to realize how much we don't know about the people around us. Meanwhile, Jerry is sitting in an alehouse, puzzling over the meaning of his latest assignment. He can't figure out the message that he's supposed to deliver, at all. Nonetheless, he decides to set off to London to deliver it. Meanwhile, the mail coach rattles its way down the road to Dover. Inside, Mr. Lorry dozes as he thinks. All of the sounds in the mail coach begin to sound like the sounds he knows so well--the sounds of Tellson's bank. Despite the comforting sounds of the bank, however, Mr. Lorry remains uneasy. He's uneasy because he's been given a difficult task: he's about to dig up the dead. Ugh! Wait, isn't that illegal? Well, yes. But that's not the sort of digging we're talking about. We'll get to that later. For now, though, Mr. Lorry imagines a conversation that he has with the dead. He asks the dead man if he's been recalled to life; the dead man says that he doesn't know. He asks the dead man if he'd like to see "her." The man has a different answer for each time Mr. Lorry imagines the conversation. Sometimes he's very happy, other times he's almost angry. Playing the conversation out in his head over and over again, Mr. Lorry finally asks the dead man how long he's been buried. The answer, "eighteen years," terrifies Mr. Lorry.
38,,As Lucie and her father step out of the courtroom, our narrator takes some time to catch us up on their lives. Dr. Manette is looking worlds better. Our narrator is pretty sure that this is all Lucie's doing: she's brought him back to life. Everyone congratulates everyone else on Darnay's release. Mr. Stryver, Darnay's lawyer, seems to be taking most of the credit for the legal maneuver that saved his life. Of course, that would be forgetting Carton's role in the affair--which our narrator wouldn't want us to do. Unsurprisingly, pointing out the similarity between Carton and Darnay was Carton's own idea. He was the brains behind the operation. Mr. Lorry asks if "a man of business" might now approach Charles Darnay. As we quickly realize, however, anytime Mr. Lorry wants to be a "man of business," it rarely works well. He's soon congratulating Charles just like everyone else. Carton, who still seems pretty cynical about the justice system , wants to get out of the general area of the court. He asks Darnay to come out to dinner with him. Aww...a blossoming friendship? Well, not exactly. Darnay can't seem to break through Carton's cynicism. And Carton's already seen how Darnay looks at Lucie. In fact, just because Carton seems to like rubbing salt in his own wounds, he gets Darnay to propose a toast to "Miss Manette!" After sharing a drink or two together, Carton's pretty sure he doesn't like Darnay. Darnay sure doesn't like Carton. Perhaps they might even get into blows over Lucie...until, of course, Darnay realizes that Carton has just saved his life. Before they part, however, Darnay wants to know why Carton seems so angry and depressed. Muttering that he's a "disappointed drudge," Carton says that he's been worth nothing all his life. As Darnay leaves, Carton engages in a little bit of existential self-questioning. Why hasn't he been able to change his own circumstances in life? Why isn't he ever able to change his ways or become a better human being? Tough questions. And Carton's got no answers.
39,,The Marquis' carriage heads out into the country. As he drives, our narrator gives us a description of the land. It's parched and almost dead. All the crops that can be wrung out of the land have been grown and are slowly dying--like the poor people who farm them. Heading into the village, the carriage pauses. Our narrator takes this time to explain why the village looks so crummy, as well. See, the Marquis has been taxing his villagers within an inch of their lives. They don't have the money to buy food or care for their children because they're sending all of their money to the Marquis. In the village, the Marquis pulls aside a man whom he passed on the road. Understandably, the guy's a bit nervous. The Marquis isn't exactly known for his generosity around here. The Marquis demands to know what the guy was staring at when the carriage passed him by a few minutes before. Gulping, the man says that he was staring at another man who was riding below the carriage as a stowaway. Angry and astonished, the Marquis demands to know more. The peasant describes the stowaway as a tall, thin, white-faced man. Gabelle, the town tax collector and postmaster, steps forward to take charge of a hunt for the mysterious man. The Marquis' carriage heads out of town. They've almost reached the Marquis' country estate when a single woman stops them on the road. She's poor and desperate. Her husband has just died, their farm yields no money, and now her children are starving. She's not asking for food, however. She'd just like money to build a small tombstone for her husband. See, the woman is about to die, as well--and she's very upset at the thought that the townspeople won't be able to bury her beside her husband. Right now there's nothing to mark his grave. Without a headstone, no one will know where he was buried. Any guesses as to what the Marquis will do? Exactly. He rides away without listening to another word. Just in case you were wondering, this is exhibit B in the case Dickens is building. Case? What case? Well, we'll call it the "Why the Marquis is a heartless monster" case, for now. Hmm...killing a small child and ignoring the pleas of a desperate woman. Sounds like the Marquis is a monster after all. Luckily for him, he doesn't care. His carriage pulls up to a magnificent country mansion. As the Marquis gets out, he asks if Monsieur Charles has arrived yet. Hang on a second...don't we already know a Charles? What's going on here?
40,,Back in England, Charles Darnay, ex-French aristocrat, is making a decent living as a tutor. What does he teach? French, of course. Everything's coming up roses for him. Sure, it's not as lucrative as a decades-old title, but he's making honest pay for an honest day's work. Also, he's madly in love with Lucie. That is what's top on his mind as he heads over to Soho to the Manettes' house. The doctor is at home. His life has only continued to improve. He's working all the time, which makes him pretty happy. He hasn't relapsed into depression or memory loss in a long time. Darnay walks into the room, and Dr. Manette greets him happily. They haven't seen each other in a few days: Darnay has been busy working with his students, and the doctor has his patients. The doctor remarks that it's unfortunate that Lucie isn't around to greet him, as well. Darnay cuts him short. He knew that Lucie wasn't in. Sensing that this will be a conversation that he won't like, Dr. Manette asks Darnay to remember how essential Lucie is to his well-being. Darnay says he understands. He wouldn't mention her name--but he loves her too much to keep quiet any longer. Dr. Manette already knows this. He asks Darnay if Darnay has said anything about his love to Lucie. Darnay says that he'd never approach Lucie without telling Dr. Manette first. In fact, that's why he's here. Aww...what a gentleman, huh? Explaining that he understands how important Lucie is in Dr. Manette's life, Darnay says that he'll never do anything that would jeopardize their relationship. In fact, if he married Lucie, he'd want to move in with them. That way, their house would be disrupted as little as possible. Dr. Manette asks if Darnay wants him to say anything to Lucie about this conversation. Darnay immediately refuses. He knows how much Dr. Manette's opinion matters to Lucie. If he told her to jump, she'd ask "How high?" Okay, that's not actually in the book. But if he told her to consider Darnay as a husband, she'd marry him--without thinking about whether or not she loved him. Darnay doesn't want this. He asks Dr. Manette not to say anything. What he does ask, however, is that Dr. Manette agree to tell Lucie of this conversation if she comes to her father to talk about Darnay. In the interests of full disclosure, Darnay also wants to tell Dr. Manette about his past...in France. Dr. Manette seems startled. He immediately shuts Darnay down. He doesn't want to know about Darnay's history. Okay, okay: if Lucie and Darnay get married, then Darnay can tell him about his past. But that's a big if. Darnay leaves, happy with their conversation. A few hours later, Lucie returns from her shopping trip. Miss Pross meets her at the door. She's frantic. Ever since Darnay left, Dr. Manette has been up in his room, pacing the way that he used to. And he's been working at making shoes again. He won't come down. In fact, he doesn't seem to hear her when she calls. Lucie runs upstairs. Their voices are heard upstairs. Eventually the two come down; she convinces her father to fall asleep.
41,,Mr. Stryver's decided to bestow his magnanimous offer on Lucie. We want to vomit just thinking of it. He offers to take her out--twice. Unaccountably, she refuses. Not to worry, though. Stryver's sure that he's going to win her over. He's on his way to Soho to visit Dr. Manette when he happens to walk by Tellson's. Since he knows that Mr. Lorry is a good friend of the Manettes, he drops by to share the good news. Mr. Lorry thinks that Mr. Stryver is too loud and too brazen to fit in well at Tellson's. In fact, the guy sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. Mr. Lorry tries to get Stryver to tone it down a bit, but Stryver doesn't seem to get the message. Glibly unaware of how arrogant he sounds, Stryver tells Mr. Lorry that he plans to marry Lucie. Mr. Lorry's upset. He knows exactly what the Manettes think of Stryver. Unsurprisingly, they don't think too much of him. He gently tries to break this to Stryver. Stryver's not the brightest kid in class. He keeps telling Mr. Lorry how perfect a suitor he is. After all, he's a prosperous lawyer. He's respectable and even well-off. Who wouldn't love him? In fact, after telling Mr. Lorry all about himself, Stryver's pretty sure that he should march right over to the Manettes' house and propose. Mr. Lorry disagrees. He's fairly certain that the whole thing will turn out...well, it won't be pretty. Stryver can't understand why this would be the case. After a bit of heated conversation, Mr. Lorry manages to get Stryver to agree to postpone proposing to Lucie right away. He tries to warn Stryver that Lucie might not think that Stryver is the amazing man that Stryver thinks he is. Instead, Mr. Lorry offers to head over to the Manette house to test the waters for Stryver. He's pretty sure that he knows what the answer will be, but he wants to save Stryver from the embarrassment of a proposal. Stryver agrees to wait for a day until Mr. Lorry returns. After all, he follows Carton's lead on everything else. Why wouldn't he follow Mr. Lorry's lead on this? That's what Mr. Lorry's banking on. He heads over to the Manette house immediately. Mr. Stryver stretches out on the couch in Mr. Lorry's office and waits for him to return with an answer.
42,,London. The night before Lucie's wedding. Lucie sits by her father's side underneath a tree in their yard. She's very, very happy. She worries, however, that her father will be made unhappy by her upcoming marriage. Asking to be reassured that nothing will be changed by her marriage, she begs her father to tell her if he will be at all unhappy in the future. Dr. Manette assures Lucie that he will be happier if she's fully happy. After all, he realizes that she's devoted herself to him. He wouldn't want her life to be spent completely in tending for an old man. As he sits looking at the moon, Dr. Manette remembers the times that the moon was the only thing he could see from his prison window. He tells Lucie that he used to look at the moon and dream of the child whom he'd abandoned when he was sent to prison. Imagining that she'd forgotten him completely, the doctor used to think that the child would grow up without any thought of him troubling her mind. Lucie interrupts him. She's troubled by the thought that he could imagine her to be uncaring. Dr. Manette gently stops her. At other times, he explains, he would imagine his daughter leading him out of his prison cell into the world. This vision, he insisted, was a specter. Lucie struggles to understand all of this. Continuing, the doctor says that, at other times, he imagined his child with a full and happy life--one that he came into when he left prison. That, Lucie recognizes, was his dream of her. The next day, Lucie will get married. No one is invited to the ceremony but Mr. Lorry. Miss Pross will be there, as well. That night, Miss Pross, Lucie, and the doctor have a cheerful supper together. After the doctor goes to bed, Lucie creeps into his room to check on him. He's sleeping soundly. Relieved, she goes to sleep herself.
43,,The first person to visit Lucie and Darnay after they get married is Sydney Carton. Are you really surprised? Darnay is. He's even more surprised when Carton makes a rather strange request: he wants to be Darnay's friend. There's not exactly a ton of love lost between the two men, remember? Nonetheless, Carton wants to be pals. More specifically, he wants to be able to pop over to their house without any warning, just like an old family friend would. Darnay doesn't seem especially inclined to agree, but Carton reminds him of how Carton saved his life in court. Okay, he's got Darnay there. Darnay agrees to be friends. That doesn't mean, however, that he has to like it. Later in the day, he grumbles to Lucie about Carton's strange request. Astonishingly, Lucie gets a bit angry at him for saying mean things about Carton. She tells Darnay to remember that they're very, very happy together--and that Carton is very, very unhappy. As she says, it's hard for happy people to judge unhappy people. It just doesn't seem fair. Darnay seems pretty wowed by the wonderfulness of his wife. The two newlyweds agree to always be kind to poor old Carton. Lucie kisses Darnay and thanks him for his kindness. Darnay kisses Lucie and blesses her for her compassion. Life, in other words, is pretty perfect.
44,,We're back in the French countryside. It's just about as dismal as when we left it: there's no food, the crops are withered, and the people are in about the same condition as the crops. Despite this, things seem to have changed somehow. For years, Monseigneur has squeezed and starved the poor of the village. Now, however, the faces of the poor have a new look. It's one that Monseigneur can't quite figure out. Our old friend, the mender of roads, is out mending roads. After all, what else would he be doing? A man walks up to him, greets him as Jacques, and the two sit down to eat together. The mender of roads asks if it's happening tonight. What? What's happening? Just wait...we'll find out soon enough. The traveler wants to take a nap. He asks the mender of roads to wake him at sunset. It's now sunset. The mender of roads wakes the traveler. Hey, we told you it was going to happen. They shake hands. The traveler asks a cryptic question: is it two leagues away? The answer is yes. Later that night, the chateau on the hill begins to burn. Vast clouds of smoke and flames can be seen from the town. Monsieur Gabelle, the guy who's in charge of the town, awakens to find a rider at his door. Frantic, the rider asks Monsieur Gabelle to send village folks up to the chateau. Everyone in the village looks at each other. Amazingly enough, no one wants to help put out the fire. The chateau burns. After the blaze dies down a little bit, folks start to remember that the Marquis wasn't the only aristocrat in town. Gabelle was the one who collected the Marquis' taxes. Okay, so he's not really an aristocrat. But he's close enough, isn't he? That seems to be the general consensus. People start to beat down Gabelle's door. He takes the advice of his friends and puts a heavy bolt on the door. As night descends, we leave Gabelle praying that he won't get strung up on a pike.
45,,Tellson's has set up temporary offices in the abandoned palace of an aristocrat. From this rather inauspicious location, Mr. Lorry has been making lots and lots of financial decisions. Riches have to be preserved , papers have to be saved, even more papers have to be burned...all in all, he's been a pretty busy guy. Fortunately, Tellson's seems to be in a safe space for now. Mr. Lorry looks out into the courtyard, where a large grindstone has been set up. The patriots use the courtyard as a space where they re-grind the edges of their weapons. Strangely enough, that makes the building a fairly safe place to be. As Mr. Lorry looks out the window, he receives a violent shock: Lucie and her father are coming in the courtyard door. Quickly, Mr. Lorry opens the door and rushes them inside. Lucie tells him that Darnay has come to the city. Immediately, Mr. Lorry realizes what this means. Darnay is in trouble. He tries to shield the Manettes from the windows, but the doctor coolly ignores him. Dr. Manette, you see, is something of a hero for the patriots. As a former prisoner of the Bastille, he's untouchable. In fact, he might even have some leverage in getting Darnay out of prison. That's why he and Lucie had come to Paris. Mr. Lorry actually agrees. He hurries Lucie up to his room, and then he and the doctor look out the window. Patriots are grinding weapons like mad. The entire courtyard has become stained with blood. Sparks fly off the grindstone, making the entire place look something like a hell on earth. Mr. Lorry whispers to the doctor that the patriots have begun murdering prisoners. Dr. Manette sighs and goes out into the crowd. Soon Mr. Lorry hears the crowd screaming, "Long live the Bastille prisoner!" He watches as Dr. Manette is carried out into the streets by the mob. Later that night, he and Lucie wait upstairs for Dr. Manette to return. Lucie listens, startled, as the grindstone works through the night.
46,,Dr. Manette doesn't return for four days. When he finally makes it back to the house, he tells Lucie a condensed version of what he's seen. Mr. Lorry, however, gets the full story: Dr. Manette went to the Tribunal that tries all the prisoners. He announced himself as a former prisoner of the Bastille, and was awarded special status in the Tribunal. From his seat, he saw Darnay brought before the court and almost released. At the last minute, however, the President of the Tribunal got some new information. He ordered that Darnay be held in prison. He won't be executed, but he won't be set free. Dr. Manette describes the Tribunals as madness. There's not any justice or even any attempt at observing any laws. Finally, however, he decides to use all the influence he has to save Darnay. In fact, for the first time since he was released from prison, he seems like a socially powerful man. The doctor becomes the head medical inspector of three prisons. In that position, he's able to bring back occasional news of Darnay. Strangely enough, Mr. Lorry observes that the doctor begins to take pride in his ability to do things for his family. For a long time, Lucie took care of him. Now he's able to return the favor. Nonetheless, despite all the doctor's efforts, Darnay remains in prison. Time passes without any real markers. And now, friends, we're introduced to the real star of this novel: the guillotine. Our narrator takes a good, long time to describe the ways that it influences and symbolizes the new Republic. It's actually a really good bit of the novel--we recommend that you check it out for yourselves. The doctor moves through all the madness of this time. The guillotine chops off heads right and left, Darnay remains in prison, and Lucie...waits.
47,,It's the morning of Darnay's trial. Five judges sit at the Tribunal bench. The audience hall is packed with people here to see a show. One woman sits in the front row, knitting. Beside her, Darnay sees Defarge. Dr. Manette sits right beneath the president of the Tribunal, ready to testify. Darnay's charges are read: he's an emigrant, and all emigrants are subject to death. It doesn't matter, of course, that this law was instituted after Darnay came to France. The crowd seems to agree. They immediately call for his death. Darnay testifies that he's been living in England and earning his own money there. He even married a woman in England. When asked, Darnay announces that his wife is Lucie, the daughter of Dr. Manette. The crowd gasps in astonishment. This is an even better show than they'd anticipated. The president asks why Darnay chose to return to France. Darnay explains that he felt a moral obligation to return, even though he'd given up any claim to his own lands long ago. He'd come back to save a citizen's life. How could this be criminal? The audience now agrees with Darnay. They shout pretty loudly to save him. Audiences are pretty fickle, in case you haven't noticed. The president reads Gabelle's letter to Darnay aloud. Now Dr. Manette takes the stand. When he testifies that Darnay had actually been on trial in England for being a foe to England and a friend of the United States, the crowd goes crazy. The French helped the U.S. in the American Revolution, remember? Therefore, Darnay must be a good guy! The jury adds its voices to the choir: Darnay is set free! Crying "Long Live the Republic!" the crowd hoists Darnay on people's shoulders and carries him out of the courtroom. He's like a football hero: no one can get enough of him. Soon, though, the Manettes manage to get him home. Lucie and Darnay fall onto the floor, praying in thanks for Darnay's release. Dr. Manette enters and Lucie runs to him, trembling. Smiling, the doctor tells her to be strong. He's saved Darnay.
48,,In England, the Dover mail coach makes its way up a hill one late November night. The foreboding atmosphere of night and mist makes everyone uneasy -- the passengers, the coachman, and the guard. Highway robberies are common, and the travelers are as wary of each other as they are of anyone else they might meet on the road. As the coach reaches the top of the hill, the travelers hear a horse approaching at a gallop. The rider, Jerry, is a messenger from Tellson's Bank in London, and he has a message for one of the passengers, Mr. Jarvis Lorry, an employee of the bank. Mr. Lorry reads the message, which states, "Wait at Dover for Mam'selle."Mr. Lorry tells Jerry to return the answer, "Recalled to Life,"and the coach continues on its way. As Jerry gallops back to London, he muses over Mr. Lorry's mysterious response.
49,,As the coach rattles its way toward Dover, Mr. Lorry dozes restlessly, reflecting upon his mission, "to dig some one out of a grave"who has been "buried alive for eighteen years."He envisions what the face of the man must look like and contemplates how severely the years may have affected him. Haunted by visions of the man's face, Mr. Lorry imagines a dialogue in which he repeatedly asks the man, "I hope you care to live?"and the man always responds, "I can't say."
50,,Jerry is told to take a note to Mr. Lorry at the Old Bailey law court and to stay there until Mr. Lorry needs him. After arriving at the Old Bailey and giving the doorkeeper the note to deliver to Mr. Lorry, Jerry makes his way into the crowded courtroom. The court is hearing a treason case, punishable by the grisly sentence of being drawn and quartered. The accused, Charles Darnay, stands quietly and calmly before the crowd until he catches sight of Lucie and Doctor Manette , who are witnesses against him. The spectators follow his eyes and are touched by Lucie's expression of fear and sympathy for Darnay.
51,,After a waiter at the tavern awakens him, Carton walks from the tavern to Stryver's chambers. The two work on some cases, with Carton doing the brunt of the work. When they finish, Carton and Stryver discuss their school days together and the differences in their fortunes -- how Stryver moved ahead in his profession while Carton remained in Stryver's shadow. The discussion turns to Lucie, whom Stryver admires and whom Carton dismisses as "a golden-haired doll."With dawn breaking, Carton heads home, envisioning for a moment how much richer his life might have been if he had been a man who practiced self-denial and perseverance. Facing the reality of his empty room, he goes to bed, falling asleep on a pillow wet with tears.
52,,The same night that Darnay makes his declaration to Doctor Alexandre Manette, Stryver tells Carton that he has decided to marry Lucie. Stryver feels that he is doing Lucie a favor by making her his wife; she is not rich, but she is "a charming creature"who will make a nice home for him. After describing how eligible and attractive he is to women, Stryver chastises Carton for making himself so unattractive to women. He recommends that Carton find himself a wife to take care of him, all the while missing the sarcasm in Carton's replies.
53,,Having decided to wed Lucie, Stryver heads to Soho to let her know of her good fortune. On the way, he drops by Tellson's Bank to share his marriage plans with Mr. Lorry. Rather than risk making Doctor Alexandre Manette or Lucie uncomfortable by receiving a proposal directly from Stryver, Mr. Lorry suggests that Stryver let him visit the Manettes and find out if Lucie would accept Stryver's suit. Stryver agrees, and when Mr. Lorry returns from Soho, he tells Stryver that he should drop his suit. However, Stryver has already changed his mind and acts as if the incident was all a misunderstanding caused by Lucie.
54,,The night before Lucie's wedding, she and her father sit outside and discuss her upcoming marriage. Lucie tells her father how happy she is and assures him that her love for Darnay will not interfere with their relationship. Doctor Alexandre Manette responds by telling her that marriage is a natural step for her to take and that he is grateful that his imprisonment has not shadowed her life as it has his. He relates to her that when he was in prison he would think of the child he had never known and wonder what its fate was. No matter what he imagined, though, he could never have imagined the degree of happiness that Lucie brought into his life.
55,,On the tenth morning, Doctor Alexandre Manette awakens fully recovered and unaware that anything unusual has transpired. Mr. Lorry tactfully conveys to the Doctor what has happened and asks what caused the relapse and how it can be prevented. The Doctor explains that he expected the relapse, which was caused by the revival of certain memories. He believes that the worst is over and doubts that another relapse could occur; if one did, it would most likely result from an intense experience that revived those same memories. Mr. Lorry also questions the wisdom of keeping the shoemaking bench and materials, pointing out that their presence reminds the Doctor of the past that has caused him so much pain. Uneasily agreeing, Doctor Manette requests that Mr. Lorry dispose of the bench and tools without him. Therefore, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross bury the tools and burn the shoemaking bench after the Doctor leaves to join Lucie and Darnay on their trip.
56,,One July day, a stranger approaches the road-mender and asks for directions to the Evremonde chateau. That night, four figures set fire to the chateau and the villagers watch it burn, making no effort to put it out despite the pleas of servants from the chateau. Excited by the destruction of the chateau, the villagers threaten Gabelle, the local tax collector, who hides on his roof while the villagers pound on his door.
57,,Despite his personal devotion to Lucie and her daughter, Mr. Lorry recognizes as a businessman that keeping the family of a La Force prisoner at Tellson's could endanger the bank. Consequently, he finds a nearby apartment for them and leaves Jerry Cruncher there to protect them. The day drags on with no word from Doctor Alexandre Manette. Finally, that evening, Monsieur Defarge delivers a message to Mr. Lorry from the Doctor, which states that Darnay is safe for the moment and that Defarge has a note from Darnay to Lucie. As Mr. Lorry takes Defarge to see Lucie, Madame Defarge and The Vengeance join them. Defarge explains that the women want to see Lucie and her child so that they can identify and protect her, should the need arise. After reading the message from her husband, Lucie thanks Madame Defarge and begs her to help Darnay. Madame Defarge responds coldly to Lucie's entreaties. When Miss Pross and young Lucie present themselves to Madame Defarge, she barely notices Miss Pross, focusing instead on young Lucie and casting a literal and figurative shadow on both Lucie and her daughter.
58,,After four days, Doctor Alexandre Manette finally returns from the prison. He tells Mr. Lorry how he tried to influence the court tribunal to free his son-in-law, but only secured a guarantee of Darnay's safety. He also recounts the erratic behavior of the mob, which one minute would violently attack condemned prisoners and the next minute would exuberantly cheer the freeing of other prisoners. Feeling strong in his power as a Bastille survivor, Doctor Manette is confident that he will be able to free Darnay. Despite the Doctor's efforts, though, Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months. In the meantime, the Doctor becomes well known throughout Paris and gains status as the inspecting physician for three prisons.
59,,At the trial the next day, Darnay offers an articulate and well-planned defense of himself. However, the jury remains unconvinced of his innocence until Doctor Alexandre Manette and Mr. Lorry testify on his behalf. The court spectators who called for Darnay's head at the beginning of the trial cheer wildly when the jury votes to free him. As the crowd swarms around Darnay and carries him home, the rapid change in his situation bewilders him. When he reaches home, he embraces Lucie and his daughter, and he and Lucie pray together in thanks. Afterward, Lucie embraces her father, who is proud of what he has accomplished.
60,,The Period It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. As its title promises, this brief chapter establishes the era in which the novel takes place: England and France in 1775. The age is marked by competing and contradictory attitudes--"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"--but resembles the "present period" in which Dickens writes. In England, the public worries over religious prophecies, popular paranormal phenomena in the form of "the Cock-lane ghost," and the messages that a colony of British subjects in America has sent to King George III. France, on the other hand, witnesses excessive spending and extreme violence, a trend that anticipates the erection of the guillotine. Yet in terms of peace and order, English society cannot "justify much national boasting" either--crime and capital punishment abound
61,,The Mail On a Friday night in late November of 1775, a mail coach wends its way from London to Dover. The journey proves so treacherous that the three passengers must dismount from the carriage and hike alongside it as it climbs a steep hill. From out of the great mists, a messenger on horseback appears and asks to speak to Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank. The travelers react warily, fearing that they have come upon a highwayman or robber. Mr. Lorry, however, recognizes the messenger's voice as that of Jerry Cruncher, the odd-job man at Tellson's, and accepts his message. The note that Jerry passes him reads: "Wait at Dover for Mam'selle. Lorry instructs Jerry to return to Tellson's with this reply: "Recalled to Life. Confused and troubled by the "blazing strange message," Jerry rides on to deliver it
62,,Five Years Later It is now 1780. Tellson's Bank in London prides itself on being "very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. Were it more welcoming, the bank's partners believe, it would lose its status as a respectable business. It is located by Temple Bar, the spot where, until recently, the government displayed the heads of executed criminals. The narrator explains that at this time, "death was a recipe much in vogue," used against all manner of criminals, from forgers to horse thieves to counterfeiters. Jerry Cruncher, employed by Tellson's as a runner and messenger, wakes up in his small apartment, located in an unsavory London neighborhood. He begins the day by yelling at his wife for "praying against" him; he throws his muddy boot at her. Around nine o'clock, Cruncher and his young son camp outside Tellson's Bank, where they await the bankers' instructions. When an indoor messenger calls for a porter, Cruncher takes off to do the job. As young Jerry sits alone, he wonders why his father's fingers always have rust on them
63,,The Jackal Sydney Carton, the "idlest and most unpromising of men," makes his way from the tavern to Mr. Stryver's apartment. The men drink together and discuss the day's court proceedings. Stryver, nicknamed "the lion," compliments his friend, "the jackal," for the "rare point" that he made regarding Darnay's identification. However, he laments Carton's moodiness. Ever since their days in school together, Stryver observes, Carton has fluctuated between highs and lows, "now in spirits and now in despondency. Carton shrugs off Stryver's accusation that his life lacks a unified direction. Unable to match Stryver's vaulting ambition, Carton claims that he has no other choice but to live his life "in rust and repose. Attempting to change the subject, Stryver turns the conversation to Lucie, praising her beauty. Carton dismisses her as a "golden-haired doll," but Stryver wonders about Carton's true feelings for her
64,,Monseigneur in the Country The Marquis arrives in the small village to which he serves as lord. There, too, the people live wretched lives, exploited, poor, and starving. As he looks over the submissive faces of the peasants, he singles out a road-mender whom he passed on his journey, a man whose fixed stare bothered him. He demands to know what the road-mender was staring at, and the man responds that someone was holding onto the bottom of the carriage. The Marquis continues on his way and soon comes upon a peasant woman, mourning at a rustic graveside. The woman stops him and begs that he provide her husband's grave with some stone or marker, lest he be forgotten, but the Marquis drives away, unmoved. He arrives at his chateau and, upon entering, asks if Monsieur Charles has arrived from England
65,,The Fellow of Delicacy The next day, Stryver plans to take Lucie to the Vauxhall Gardens to make his marriage proposal. On his way, he drops in at Tellson's Bank, where he informs Mr. Lorry of his intentions. Lorry persuades Stryver to postpone his proposal until he knows for certain that Lucie will accept. This admonition upsets Stryver. He almost insults Lucie as a "mincing Fool," but Lorry warns him against doing so. Lorry asks that Stryver hold off his proposal for a few hours to give him time to consult the family and see exactly where Stryver stands. Later that night, Lorry visits Stryver and reports that his fears have been confirmed. If Stryver were to propose, the Manettes would reject his offer. Stryver dismisses the entire affair as one of the "vanities" of "empty-headed girls" and begs Lorry to forget it
66,,One Night It is the eve of Lucie's marriage to Darnay. Lucie and her father have enjoyed long days of happiness together. Doctor Manette finally has begun to put his imprisonment behind him. For the first time since his release, Manette speaks of his days in the Bastille. In prison, he passed much time imagining what sort of person Lucie would grow up to be. He is very happy now, thanks to Lucie, who has brought him "consolation and restoration. Later that night, Lucie sneaks down to her father's room and finds him sleeping soundly
67,,Nine Days Darnay and Doctor Manette converse before going to church for Darnay's wedding to Lucie. Manette emerges "deadly pale" from this meeting. Darnay and Lucie are married and depart for their honeymoon. Almost immediately, a change comes over Manette; he now looks scared and lost. Later that day, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry discover Manette at his shoemaker's bench, lapsed into an incoherent state. They fear that he will not recover in time to join the newlyweds, as planned, on the honeymoon, and for nine days they keep careful watch over him
68,,A Plea When Lucie and Darnay return home from their honeymoon, Sydney Carton is their first visitor. He apologizes for his drunkenness on the night of the trial and delivers a self-effacing speech in which he asks for Darnay's friendship: "If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow. coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person. Carton leaves. Afterward, Darnay comments that Carton tends to be careless and reckless. Lucie deems this judgment too harsh and insists that Carton possesses a good, though wounded, heart. Lucie's compassion touches Darnay, and he promises to regard Carton's faults with sympathy
69,,The Grindstone Lucie and Doctor Manette storm into the Paris branch of Tellson's Bank to find Mr. Lorry. They inform him that Darnay sits imprisoned in La Force. Manette remains confident that he can use his standing as a one-time prisoner of the Bastille to help rescue his son-in-law. Lorry sends Lucie into the back room of the bank so that he can speak to Manette in private. He and Manette look out into the courtyard, where throngs of people sharpen their weapons on a grindstone. Lorry explains that the mob is preparing to kill the prisoners. Manette rushes into the crowd, and soon a cry arises: "Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force
70,,Calm in Storm Four days later, Manette returns from La Force. Lorry notes a change in the once-fragile Manette, who now seems full of strength and power. Manette tells him that he has persuaded the Tribunal, a self-appointed body that tries and sentences the revolution's prisoners, to keep Darnay alive. Moreover, he has secured a job as the inspecting physician of three prisons, one of which is La Force. These duties will enable him to ensure Darnay's safety. Time passes, and France rages as though in a fever. The revolutionaries behead the king and queen, and the guillotine becomes a fixture in the Paris streets. Darnay remains in prison for a year and three months
71,,Triumph A motley and bloodthirsty crowd assembles at the trial of Charles Darnay. When Doctor Manette is announced as Darnay's father-in-law, a happy cry goes up among the audience. The court hears testimony from Darnay, Manette, and Gabelle, establishing that Darnay long ago had renounced his title out of disapproval of the aristocracy's treatment of peasants. These factors, in addition to Darnay's status as the son-in-law of the much-loved martyr Manette, persuade the jury to acquit him. The crowd carries Darnay home in a chair on their shoulders
72,,Dusk The courtroom crowd pours into the streets to celebrate Darnay's condemnation. John Barsad, charged with ushering Darnay back to his cell, lets Lucie embrace her husband one last time. Darnay insists that Doctor Manette not blame himself for the trial's outcome. Darnay is escorted back to his cell to await his execution the following morning, and Carton escorts the grieving Lucie to her apartment. Carton tells Manette to try his influence one last time with the prosecutors and then meet him at Tellson's, though Lorry feels certain that there is no hope for Darnay, and Carton echoes the sentiment
73,,The Footsteps Die Out Forever Crush humanity out of shape once more. and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of. oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind. Carton and the young seamstress reach the guillotine. The Vengeance and the other revolutionary women worry that Madame Defarge will miss the beheading of Charles Darnay. The seamstress reflects that the new Republic may make life easier for poor people like herself and her surviving cousin. She kisses Carton and goes calmly to her death. Carton then goes to his. The narrator recounts that those who saw Carton die witnessed a peaceful and even prophetic look on his face, and speculates confidently about Carton's final thoughts: Carton notes the fact that the oppressors in the crowd "have risen on the destruction of the old," but also realizes that, someday, Paris will recover from these horrors and become beautiful. Also in these imagined last moments, Carton sees Lucie and Darnay with a child named after himself. He sees Manette happy and healthy and sees Lorry living a long and peaceful life. He sees a future in which he holds a special place in their hearts and in the hearts of generations hence. He sees his own name "made illustrious," and the blots that he threw upon his life fade away. According to the narrator, Carton dies in the knowledge that "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free,. I see the evil of this time. gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out
74,,Lucie and Dr. Manette burst into Mr. Lorry's room in the Paris branch of Tellson's Bank. They tell him that the revolutionaries have imprisoned Charles and Mr. Lorry calms Lucie and she goes to rest in another room. Mr. Lorry informs Dr. Manette that the mob is butchering prisoners in the La Force prison. Dr. Manette is famous in that he has survived eighteen years in the Bastille and has some influence over the revolutionaries so he leaves to try and save Darnay's life.
75,,Four days elapse and finally Dr. Manette returns from the prison. He has tried to influence the court tribunal to release his son-in-law, but all he has achieved is his safety for the time being. He describes the situation as very volatile saying that the mob is acting erratically. Prisoners are condemned or freed at a whim. Both decisions bring elation from the mob. The Doctors reputation spreads as time passes, but after fifteen months there has been no change in the situation.
76,,Darnay defends himself in the court and makes a well-planned and well-rehearsed defense of himself. Both Dr. Manette and Mr. Lorry testify on his behalf. The spectators are impressed, and cheer wildly when the jury acquits him. He is reunited with Lucie and his daughter who are proud of what he has accomplished.
77,,The carts carrying the fifty-two prisoners trundle through the Paris streets and the people crowd round to see Evremonde go to his death. Carton ignores the yelling throng and focuses on the seamstress. He comforts her and recalls the resurrection passage from the Bible. The Vengeance is concerned at the absence of Mme. Defarge. As he mounts the steps towards the guillotine, Carton has a vision where he foresees long and happy lives for Mr. Lorry, Dr. Manette and the Darnay family, all of who will remember him lovingly. He also pictures Lucie and Darnay having a son, whom they call Carton. The bookends with the famous line 'It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known'.
78,,The messenger, Jerry Cruncher, trots off into the darkness to deliver the message to the night watchman of Tellson's Bank. On the way, he stops a number of times to scratch his head and think about the perplexing message. In the coach, Mr. Lorry dozes and dreams about the man who has been all but buried alive in a prison for the last eighteen years.
79,,When he arrives at the bank, the clerk tells Jerry to go down to the courthouse, the Old Bailey, and wait for Mr. Lorry. The clerk gives him a note that he is supposed to pass to Mr. Lorry by way of the doorkeeper of the courthouse. The case being tried that day is for treason. The punishment is that the guilty be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Jerry Cruncher thinks the punishment is barbarous. Due to the nature of the trial, a large crowd of spectators has gathered outside the Old Bailey. Jerry Cruncher makes his way quietly through the crowd to the door of the courthouse and hands the note to the doorkeeper, as instructed. A few minutes later the door opens allowing him to squeeze in. The doorkeeper takes the note to Mr. Lorry, who is seated amidst some gentlemen in wigs. Not far away sit two more wigged gentlemen. One is Mr. Stryver, counsel for the prisoner, while the other is Mr. Sydney Carton, who sits with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling. Jerry Cruncher manages to catch the attention of Mr. Lorry who nods and signals to him to wait there. The prisoner is brought in. Everyone turns to look at him except Sydney Carton, who continues to stare at the ceiling. The prisoner is a young man of about twenty-five, good-looking, and obviously a gentleman. He is dressed plainly in dark colors, and his hair is gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck. He is self-possessed, bowing to the judges and standing quietly. He looks around the room, and his eyes rest on two witnesses, a young woman of around twenty-five and a gentleman who evidently is her father. The father looks remarkable due to the whiteness of his hair and the intense look on his face, like a man who is absorbed with his own thoughts. The daughter has one hand drawn through his arm and the other pressed upon it.
80,,Mr. Stryvers practice as a barrister has been rapidly increasing, probably due in part to his being loud-voiced and pushy. He is judged to be an intelligent lawyer who can extract the essentials from any information. He is also judged as bold and unscrupulous; perhaps that is why he is friendly with Mr. Carton. The two of them often drink together into the late hours of the night; Stryver drinks for enjoyment, while Carton drinks from frustration. It is rumored that Mr. Carton often goes home, stealthily and unsteadily, at dawn. Carton, who is the most idle and unpromising of men, accompanies Mr. Stryver on every case that he tries in court. As in Darnays trial, Carton sits silently in the courtroom with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling. Although Sydney Carton is not aggressive, he is extremely shrewd and helps Stryver plan his defense. Sometimes, he interjects something into the trial, as seen when he throws the piece of paper at Stryver during Darnays trial. It was Cartons cleverness that saved Darnay for the death penalty. Mr. Carton, who is asleep in the tavern, is awakened by a man at ten o'clock as requested. He gets up, dons his hat, and makes his way to the chambers of Mr. Stryver. They go into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers. A kettle steams on the fire, and on the table sits a large supply of wine, brandy, rum, sugar, and lemons. It becomes apparent during their meeting that even though Mr. Stryver takes all the credit for Darnay's acquittal, it is actually Mr. Carton who had planned his defense. Mr. Stryver proposes a toast to Miss Manette, whom he judges to be beautiful; Mr. Carton calls her a golden-haired doll. When Carton finally goes off to bed, he is drunk and tearful, knowing how incapable he is of taking care of himself or his interests.
81,,The Marquis makes his way from Paris through the countryside towards the Evremonde family estate. The crops on the way look dried and withered, just like the peasants. When the carriage stops at a poor village, many peasants are at the fountain washing leaves or anything else that can be eaten. The Marquis gazes with contempt at the faces around the fountain. Soon a dusty road-mender joins the group. The Marquis sends for him and asks what he was staring at when the carriage passed him down the road. The man tells him that someone was hanging underneath the carriage; he says the man was tall, covered with dust, and as white as a ghost. The Marquis is satisfied and drives on. The carriage passes a graveyard where a grief stricken woman begs him for a tombstone for the grave of her dead husband. The Marquis ignores her request and pushes her away. The carriage finally arrives at the estate after dark.
82,,Sydney Carton spends many long nights clearing up Mr. Stryver's legal matters before Stryver goes on his long vacation. Finally, on one such night after the work is complete, Mr. Stryver announces to Carton his intentions to marry. Mr. Stryver assumes that women find him tactful, ambitious, and successful and would be happy to become his wife. He thinks that Lucie would be a suitable choice even though she is poor. Mr. Stryver does not mention even once that he is in love with Lucie. Stryver also assumes that Carton is disagreeable to women and informs him of this. Carton is amused with Stryver's attitude and pokes fun at him. Stryver fails to notice the satire in Carton's remarks and aggressively continues his assault on Carton's faults. He finally says that perhaps Carton can marry a commoner, someone with property who will look after him when he ages.
83,,On the eve of her wedding day, Lucie is ecstatic and spends the entire evening with her father. As they sit in the courtyard, Lucie assures Dr. Manette that her love for Darnay will never replace or change the love she has for him. The Doctor is now happy about the marriage and states how fond he is of Darnay. One of his fears has always been that Lucie would never know the happiness of a spouse and child, which have provided him with great joy in his own life. He mentions his long imprisonment and how he had often wondered about the fate of his child, still unborn at the time of his capture. Sometimes he would imagine the child to be a boy, who would seek vengeance on his behalf. At other times he imagined the child to be a girl, who looked just like her mother and who would come to visit him in prison, finally setting him free. He confesses that the happiness that Lucie has given him far exceeds the happiness from the children about which he had dreamed. When father and daughter go inside for dinner, they are joined by Miss Pross, who is going to be the bridesmaid. Mr. Lorry is the only other person who will be present at the wedding. After dinner, the Doctor bids everyone goodnight and goes to bed. After a while, Lucie checks in on him and sits lovingly by his bedside watching her father sleep.
84,,On the morning of the wedding, Lucie, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross wait outside Dr. Manette's room. Inside, the Doctor and Charles Darnay are having a private conference. As they wait, Mr. Lorry cannot stop admiring Lucie; he grows sentimental and teary-eyed as he remembers how he brought her across from France when she was baby. Regaining his composure, Mr. Lorry assures Lucie that he will look after the Doctor while she and Darnay are away on their honeymoon. When Dr. Manette and Darnay emerge from the room, the doctor is shaken and looks deathly pale. Everyone makes their way to the church for the ceremony. After the wedding, they all return to the Manette home. Darnay and Lucie bid farewell to everyone and leave immediately for their two-week honeymoon. It has been prearranged that Dr. Manette will join them after two weeks. When Miss Pross, Mr. Lorry, and Dr. Manette are alone, Mr. Lorry notices that a great change has come over the Doctor. He again appears old, scared, and lost; but Lorry decides to say nothing about it to Dr. Manette. He takes his leave and goes to Tellson's Bank to work for several hours. When he returns to the Manettes, he finds Miss Pross in an extremely agitated state. She tells Lorry that the Doctor has been cobbling shoes. Nothing that he or Miss Pross says or does helps the Doctor snap out of his spell. In order to watch over and help with Dr. Manette, Mr. Lorry decides to take a leave of absence from Tellson's Bank. He and Miss Pross also decide to keep the doctor's reversion a secret from Lucie and everyone else. Dr. Manette continues his cobbling for nine days.
85,,Carton drops in to see the newlyweds as soon as they get back from their honeymoon. His habits, manner, and looks have not changed. He tells Darnay that he wishes they were friends and apologizes for the remarks he had made after the trial when he was drunk. Darnay assures him that he has forgotten all about it, especially since Carton had saved his life. Carton then solicits permission to visit them occasionally. Darnay grants him his request. After Carton leaves, Darnay speaks unkindly of him to the others. Later on, while they are preparing for bed, Lucie tells Darnay to be more considerate towards Carton. She feels that Carton is a deeper person with a bigger heart than he shows himself to be.
86,,Tellson's Bank in Paris is in a wing of a large house. In front of it is a courtyard that is shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house had belonged to a nobleman who had fled France, running away from the troubles of his homeland. The house has been confiscated for use by the citizen-patriots. Tellson's wing, therefore, enjoys a peculiar safety. Mr. Lorry is sitting in his room in Paris on the night of September 3, thankful that none of his friends are here to witness the terrors that surround him. A new revolutionary power, the Paris Commune, has usurped the government, including the police and prisons. Anyone suspected of being an aristocrat or sympathetic towards the aristocratic cause is immediately imprisoned. A tribunal has been appointed to decree summary justice, and the ruthless murder of prisoners, known as the September massacres, has begun. Mr. Lorry's thoughts are interrupted by the ringing of the bell at the gate. Lucie and her father rush inside. He is astonished to see them and wonders why they are in Paris. Lucie informs him of Darnays being held prisoner at La Force. Lucie is sent to an adjoining room so Mr. Lorry and Dr. Manette can talk. Lorry shows the doctor what is going on outside. Thousands of people have gathered to sharpen their bloody weapons on a grindstone. The men using the grindstone are stripped to the waist and are stained all over with blood. Mr. Lorry tells Dr. Manette that the mob is butchering all the prisoners in La Force. He tells the doctor he must act quickly to save Darnay. Dr. Manette runs out to the crowd and tells them something. He then leaves with the mob as Mr. Lorry watches from the window. He goes in to tell Lucie that her father has gone in search of Darnay.
87,,After four days, Dr. Manette finally returns from La Force. He tells of the horrors committed there by the mob and the thousands of people that have been killed. He has seen the self-appointed tribunal, which summarily tries the prisoners and sentences them to death. In an effort to save Darnay, he presents himself to the tribunal, one of whom is Defarge, and tells them of his past. He uses all his influence to have a quick and fair trial for Darnay, hoping he will be heard and released. He is told, however, that Darnay will remain imprisoned. While he and Lucie wait for Darnays trial and release, Dr. Manette devotes himself to working as a physician. Before long, he is appointed as the inspecting doctor for three prisons, among them La Force. As a result, he can regularly check on his son-in-law. He is delighted to find that Darnay is no longer in solitary confinement, but mixed with a general body of prisoners. He is also happy to be able to bring messages from Darnay to Lucie. Darnay lies in prison for one and a half years. During this time, a new era begins; France is made a republic -- of Liberty, Freedom, Equality, or Death. The king is tried for treason, condemned, and executed by guillotine. A Law of Suspects is created to allow the government to imprison anyone who is suspected of any crime. A new tribunal is set up and given extraordinary powers to try summarily all those charged with any hostility to the state. A Committee of General Security and a Committee of Public Safety are formed to hunt down and punish political crimes. The Reign of Terror has truly set in. During all these changes, Dr. Manette never stops trying to have Darnay freed.
88,,Darnay is brought in front of the dreaded Tribunal. Looking at the jury and the onlookers, he feels as though the usual order has been reversed and that now the felons are trying the honest men. The men in the courtroom are armed with various weapons while the women are wearing knives and knitting. Darnay notices Defarge and his wife; she has a spare piece of knitting under her arm and whispers into Defarge's ear. At first, the onlookers seem hostile towards Darnay, but they respond favorably when they hear that he is married to Dr. Manette's daughter. They are sympathetic to the Doctor and appreciate the work he does. Because of this, their attitude towards Darnay changes from hostility to sympathy. With Dr. Manette's testimony, Gabelle's letter as evidence, and the sympathy of the crowd, Darnay is released. As he leaves, the crowd follows him. They are jubilant, rejoicing, and dancing the Carmagnole; they lift Darnay up and carry him home. Along the way, Darnay looks for the Defarges, but they are nowhere to be seen. At first, he is a bit apprehensive about what is happening and imagines himself to be heading toward the guillotine. This feeling soon passes. Once he reaches home he hugs everyone, kisses his wife, and carries her upstairs. Lucie prays thankfully.
89,,Though Darnay is safe for the moment, Lucie feels apprehensive and is still fearful he will be killed. Lucie and her husband stay in the lodge, living modestly. Not wanting to attract attention, they send Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher to do the shopping for the family. They wonder how soon it will be safe for them to leave Paris. One day Darnay, Lucie and the Doctor are sitting silently waiting for Mr. Lorry when a loud knock is heard at the door. The Doctor opens the door to four rough men in red caps. They have come to arrest Charles Darnay. He has been denounced in the region of St. Antoine by the Defarges and a third man whom they do not identify. When asked by the Doctor what the identity of the third man is, they look surprised and wonder why he, of all people, is asking. They do not reveal his identity and merely say that they will learn everything at the trial the next day.
90,,Wollstonecraft thinks that a parent's affection for their children is actually just a blind form of self-obsession. In other words, parents who think their kids are perfect are thinking, deep down, that they are perfect. Mary also refers back to her earlier argument about parents being like tyrants, demanding blind obedience without ever wanting to justify themselves. Wollstonecraft also thinks that parents are extremely selfish when it comes to their kids, because once they have kids, they don't care about anyone else in the world. Family actually breaks down community more than it supports it. The fact is that a good mother has to be able to think for herself and be somewhat self-aware of how she raises her kids. Otherwise she'll just become another overindulgent mother who raises her kids to think that they're the center of the universe. At the end of the day, there has to be a good relationship between parents if the children are going to learn how to properly treat others. And the bond between parents must be based on friendship and not just sexual attraction, because the second one will wither over time.
91,,Hetty blushes when the Captain talks to her, and he is captivated by her kitten-like charm. The activity of butter-churning is perfectly suited to showing off her well-shaped arms. He invites the women to a dance on the 30th of June and asks for two dances from Hetty. Mrs. Poyser thinks that it will be much easier to be a tenant of the Captain than of his grandfather, because he is so good-natured that everyone will get new fences and good returns. The Captain gets Hetty alone by sending her mother off to look for Totty. The Captain asks Hetty if she ever goes out walking. Hetty says that she sometimes walks to see Mrs. Pomfret, the lady's maid, who is teaching her to mend lace. She adds that she is going to tea with Mrs. Pomfret next afternoon. Mrs. Poyser returns with Totty, and the Captain asks her if she has a pocket. Totty lifts up her dress to show him that she has one but that it is empty. The Captain gives her five sixpence and returns to find the vicar
92,,Hetty has been extremely flattered by the Captain's attentions. She knows that many men like to look at her including Adam Bede, whom she finds quite manly, She also knows that her father would like her to marry Adam. Although Hetty did not like it when his attentions to her slipped, she is not in love with him-especially because he cannot provide her with any luxuries. She is aware that the Captain went to great trouble to see her, but she does not even conceive of marrying him. She is in awe of him and finds him "as dazzling as an Olympian God. On the way home, the Captain confesses to the vicar that he finds Hetty attractive, but the vicar responds that the Captain should not give her airs because he therefore will spoil her for an honest man like Adam. The Captain says that Adam would make a better match with Mary Burge, because then he could take over her father's business. The vicar tells the Captain to look at Mary less, because then he will want her less
93,,"The dairy was certainly worth looking at" is how this chapter begins . Well, that had better be the case. Why else would it get a whole chapter? Yet Arthur, and Eliot, quickly abandon "the dairy" to stare at its pretty dairymaid. Hetty blushes deeply when handsome Arthur Donnithorne appears. Hetty is a babe. Even while she's at work, there's something splendid about her appearance, since "they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty girl is thrown in making up butter" . As Arthur looks on at Hetty, he makes her promise him a dance or two at his upcoming birthday feast. All in the presence of Mrs. Poyser, of course. And, of course, with some polite line about how "you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser" . Or is he just being polite? Arthur wants to say hello to little Totty . Mrs. Poyser goes to fetch her darling. Arthur and Hetty exchange some small talk about shipping the butter to market. Mrs. Poyser comes back with Totty. More pleasantries, more small talk, Totty shows Arthur the "tiny pink pocket" on her frock , which is, believe it or not, not a euphemism.
94,,There's "a slight quarrel" going on among the women of the Donnithorne estate . But Hetty--who'll be our eyes on the ground for this chapter--could care less. All Hetty can think of is her upcoming meeting. With Arthur. As she performs her duties around the Donnithorne estate, Hetty's "little butterfly soul" flutters "incessantly between memory and dubious expectation" . Hetty is hoping to see "Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again" in the woods . By twilight she's left chez Donnithorne and is approaching a bend in the forest path where she should run into Arthur. But he isn't there. Hetty is beginning to cry with disappointment when Arthur comes into sight after all. He notices the crying. He's kind as can be. And yet, he feels very, very "uncomfortable" . Arthur departs quickly, yet kindly, and rushes homeward. Yes, this is troubling stuff, this "attracted to a girl you could never, ever, ever marry" business. And Arthur needs a sympathetic ear. He decides that he will "go and tell Mr. Irwine--tell him everything" . He'll be able to sleep easy then.
95,,Seth sees Dinah home after the meeting; she is staying with her uncle and aunt, the Poysers, at the Hall Farm. He asks her to marry him, feeling her to be a beautiful soul, full of goodness. Dinah gently refuses, explaining that she wants to live without a family. Her whole life is dedicated to serving others, and she has no heart for considering her own selfish desires. Seth accepts her decision with regret and resignation; there are no hard feelings.
96,,Captain Donnithorne and Mrs. Poyser go to the dairy, where Captain Donnithorne first lays eyes on Hetty. A beautiful young girl, Hetty is the seventeen-year-old niece of Mr. Poyser. The Poysers took her in after she was orphaned, and she lives with them at Hall Farm and helps Mrs. Poyser with household chores. Captain Donnithorne flirts with Hetty, even going so far as to ask Mrs. Poyser to go get her small daughter, Totty, in order to have a few moments alone with Hetty. Hetty responds coquettishly to his advances. Captain Donnithorne asks Hetty when she will next be at the Chase, where Captain Donnithorne lives, and Hetty reveals her plans to visit a housekeeper at the estate the next day
97,,Hetty walks home by the same route in the woods through which she came. At every turn, she hopes and prays to see Captain Donnithorne, but he is not there. She becomes so anxious that she begins to cry. She finally comes upon Captain Donnithorne, who is waiting for her. When Captain Donnithorne sees Hetty's tears, he asks her what is wrong, and she says that she was afraid he would not come. He is so moved that he kisses her. Immediately after he kisses her, something bitter seems to come between them. When they part at the gate, Captain Donnithorne seems sad, as he reflects on how much his emotions have gotten the better of him. He resolves to go to Mr. Irwine in the morning and tell him everything and in so doing to cleanse himself of the wrong he has committed
98,,Hetty's World The narrator decides to go beyond Hetty's pretty exterior to see what kind of a person she is inside. This chapter tracks her thoughts about what is going on around her, but unfortunately, the narrator concludes that Hetty does not have a very large range to her soul. She is mostly concerned with her own material desires. She knows very well that she has suitors. Luke Britton of Broxton comes to church at Hayslope so he can see her. Mr. Craig the gardener at the Chase is wooing her with strawberries, and Adam Bede, who has been invited to Hall Farm for the last three years, is the one favored by her family as having brains. Hetty seems unaware of what she owes her aunt and uncle. She is an orphan, and would have been a servant someplace without their support. Her uncle hopes she will make a good marriage with Adam, who, he knows, will rise by his merits. Hetty only sees Adam as another conquest and enjoys having him in her power. With Arthur's attentions, however, she is already dreaming of greater things. She thinks only of what a man could give her, and she begins to live in a pleasant daydream of how Arthur has looked at her. An uneducated girl, she only thinks of the young squire as a god in her world. She has no sympathy beyond her own situation. On the way to the Bede cottage, Arthur confesses to Irwine how pretty he finds Hetty. Irwine warns him not to flatter her or it will make her unfit for a husband of her own class. Arthur changes the subject.
99,,Adam is called to dine with the large tenants and feels uncomfortable leaving his family downstairs, but Seth encourages him to go. He walks up with Bartle. There was a small argument about who was to sit at the top of the table, because the butler felt strongly that the elder Mr. Poyser should. Bartle settles the matter with a joke: the broadest should sit at the head and the second-broadest at the foot. Thus, Mr. Poyser gets the head and Mr. Casson gets the foot. This has put Adam next to Mr. Casson, who thinks that he is too uppity. He asks if it is the first time that Adam has dined at this table. Adam says yes and that he hopes that it is agreeable to the others at the table. A few people say that of course it is. Adam is pleased, anyway, with his seat, because he can see Hetty. Hetty is preoccupied with scolding Totty for putting her feet up on the bench because she might get dust marks on her dress. Adam cannot see the cause of her vexation, but he thinks that she looks sweet, although the moment of anger would not have looked very good on someone less pretty. Mary Burge sees Adam looking at Hetty and is glad that he has seen her out of humor because he might like her less. Hetty, knowing that Mary Burge and Adam are both looking at her, looks up at Adam and smiles brightly
100,,The tenants come in to dinner, and they argue over who is to sit at the head of the table. Adam sits with the tenants, even though, as a craftsman , he would normally sit at the lower table. He sees Hetty, who flirts with him because she knows Mary Burge, who loves Adam, is watching them
1,,One day, a little girl named Lily found a needle in her room. She knew it was difficult to play with it because it was sharp. Lily wanted to share the needle with her mom, so she could sew a button on her shirt. Lily went to her mom and said, "Mom, I found this needle. Can you share it with me and sew my shirt?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, we can share the needle and fix your shirt." Together, they shared the needle and sewed the button on Lily's shirt. It was not difficult for them because they were sharing and helping each other. After they finished, Lily thanked her mom for sharing the needle and fixing her shirt. They both felt happy because they had shared and worked together.

Beep drove under the tree and watched the leaves fall on him. He laughed and beeped his horn. Beep played with the falling leaves all day. When it was time to go home, Beep knew he needed more fuel. He went to the fuel place and got more healthy fuel. Now, Beep was ready to go fast and play again the next day. And Beep lived happily ever after.
3,,One day, a little fish named Fin was swimming near the shore. He saw a big crab and wanted to be friends. "Hi, I am Fin. Do you want to play?" asked the little fish. The crab looked at Fin and said, "No, I don't want to play. I am cold and I don't feel fine." Fin felt sad but wanted to help the crab feel better. He swam away and thought of a plan. He remembered that the sun could make things warm. So, Fin swam to the top of the water and called to the sun, "Please, sun, help my new friend feel fine and not freeze!" The sun heard Fin's call and shone its warm light on the shore. The crab started to feel better and not so cold. He saw Fin and said, "Thank you, little fish, for making me feel fine. I don't feel like I will freeze now. Let's play together!" And so, Fin and the crab played and became good friends.
4,,Once upon a time, in a land full of trees, there was a little cherry tree. The cherry tree was very sad because it did not have any friends. All the other trees were big and strong, but the cherry tree was small and weak. The cherry tree was envious of the big trees. One day, the cherry tree felt a tickle in its branches. It was a little spring wind. The wind told the cherry tree not to be sad. The wind said, "You are special because you have sweet cherries that everyone loves." The cherry tree started to feel a little better. As time went on, the cherry tree grew more and more cherries. All the animals in the land came to eat the cherries and play under the cherry tree. The cherry tree was happy because it had many friends now. The cherry tree learned that being different can be a good thing. And they all lived happily ever after.

Lily asked her friends, the cat and the dog, to help her. They all worked together to clean the cobweb. The spider was sad, but it found a new home outside. Lily, the cat, and the dog were happy they could play without the cobweb in the way. And they all lived happily ever after.

The sun was shining, and the water was warm. After a while, it was time for Tim to go home. He said goodbye to the brown kayak and gave it a big hug. The brown kayak was sad to see Tim go, but it knew they would play together again soon. So, the brown kayak kept rolling in the water, waiting for the next fun day with Tim.

Max went to his friend, the wise old owl, and said, "Owl, my knee hurts. What can I do?" The owl thought for a moment and said, "Max, you should test your knee. Try to walk slowly and see if it still hurts." So Max tested his knee by walking slowly. At first, it hurt a little, but soon Max felt better. He said, "Thank you, Owl, for your help. Now I can play with my friends again." Max was so happy that he could play with his friends without pain. He learned that sometimes, it was good to slow down and listen to his body. And Max and his friends played happily in the park ever after.
9,,One day, a fast driver named Tim went for a ride in his loud car. He loved to speed down the street and feel the wind in his hair. As he drove, he saw his friend, Sam, standing by the road.

She never imagined it would end this way.

17,,Once there was a boy who liked to run. Every day he ran faster and faster. He was so fast that he seemed to float rather than run! One day, his mommy gave him a weight to carry. It was big and heavy, but the boy didnâ€™t mind. He held on tightly and ran with it, as if it were nothing. He ran for hours and hours, never stopping for a rest. The weight grew heavier and heavier, but the boy never thought about it. He kept on running, ever faster and ever further. Then, all of a sudden, the boy felt himself trip! He had been so careless, he couldnâ€™t keep his footing. He had been running too fast and too far, with too much weight in his hands. The weight had been too heavy for him, and as he fell, he knew that he had gone much too far. Now it was time to turn around and run back home.

When she got close, Mary could see that the necklace was suspended from a thin branch. She reached out to take it in her tiny hand and felt it's cool metal. Just then, a voice called out from behind her. It was an old woman. "Do you like it?" she said. Mary was a bit anxious but nodded and smiled. "It's yours," the woman said warmly. "I saw you admiring it and thought you might like to have it." Mary thanked the woman politely, before heading home with the new silver necklace in her pocket.
