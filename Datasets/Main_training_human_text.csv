0,,(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel," said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. "In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation," said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. "We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles," said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls "virtual railroads," and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. "If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck," he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the "middle mile," rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. "A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today," said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. "Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family," said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. "The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether," he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. "In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error," said Lu. "The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted."
1,,(CNN)Working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The "Ironhand" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a "soft exoskeleton." Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.

"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run."The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called "Robo-Glove," to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job," says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team."By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator."  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030."If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there," says Krajcarski. "But this is an exciting technology."This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.

3,,New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together."The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded," said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of "zero" or "effectively zero." Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal," Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next."Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game," said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually."The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym," Winograd said. "It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not." Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. "Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon," Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. "People love their acronyms," Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves."A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio," said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro."The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile," Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. "There has been more anxiety."
4,,The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included "a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU."The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its "most-favored nation" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership."Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime," finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.

Do not believe propaganda they tell you lies here," the sign reads. "Russians against war," the last line of the sign says in English.The woman who carried out the bold act of defiance was identified as Maria Ovsyannikova, an employee of Russia Channel One, according to OVD-Info, an independent human rights protest-monitoring group. The outlet's content is tightly controlled by the Russian government.China has expressed some openness to providing military and financial aid to Russia, US cable suggestsCNN cannot independently verify the woman holding the sign is Ovsyannikova, but photos on social media profiles bearing her name match the woman seen on screen.Russian state news agency TASS confirmed OVD-Info's reporting, citing a source, and added that she could face prosecution.Read MoreFriends of Ovsyannikova told OVD-Info she was at the Ostankino Police Department in Moscow, but her lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, later told CNN he couldn't locate her. "We didn't find her for now, but we are continuing to search," Zakhvatov said.The act of protest came nearly three weeks after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine, setting off a humanitarian disaster in the country and triggering the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Satellite images show widespread destruction from Russian bombings across Ukraine, including the major cities of Kyiv and Mariupol. More than 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials estimate. More than 2.8 million residents have fled the country since the invasion began, according to United Nations refugee estimates.

The conflict explained"Unfortunately, for the past few years, I have been working on Channel One and doing Kremlin propaganda, and now I am very ashamed of it," she says in the video. "It's a shame that I allowed to speak lies from the TV screens, ashamed that I allowed to zombify Russian people.""I am ashamed that we kept silent in 2014, when all this was just beginning," she says, a reference to Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine that resulted in the annexation of Crimea. "We didn't go to rallies when the Kremlin poisoned Navalny, we just silently watched this anti-human regime and now the world has turned its back on us forever, and another ten generations of our descendants will not be able to wash away from the shame of this fraternal war.""We are Russian people, thinking and smart, and it is only in our power to stop all this madness," she says.

"This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone."Scott said Fox would provide further updates when the network knows more."Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers," Scott wrote in her memo.Fox correspondent Benjamin HallRead MoreHall started his career as a war correspondent, reporting from the Middle East and Africa and filing reports for several news organizations, including The New York Times, Sunday Times, Agence France-Presse, and BBC.In 2015, Hall joined Fox. In his role for the network, he has filed reports over the years from dangerous conflict zones, including Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.Hall currently serves as Fox's State Department correspondent. He is also the author of "Inside ISIS: The Brutal Rise of a Terrorist Army."Iryna Venediktova, prosecutor general of Ukraine, said in a Facebook post that the attack on Hall was more evidence of Russia's violence against civilians. Venediktova said she intends to focus "on those war crimes that have affected the citizens of our partner countries," according to a Google translation of her post.Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents Association, also spoke out Monday about the attack."We are horrified to learn that our fellow correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured as he covered the Ukraine war," Tandon said in a statement. "We know Ben for his warmth, good humor and utmost professionalism. We wish Ben a quick recovery and call for utmost efforts to protect journalists who are providing an invaluable service through their coverage in Ukraine."Hall's injury comes one day after Brent Renaud, an award-winning American journalist, was killed in the Ukrainian city of Irpin.Andriy Nebitov, the head of the Kyiv region police, said that Russian forces shot Renaud, adding that "the occupants cynically kill even journalists of international media, who've been trying to tell the truth about atrocities of Russian military in Ukraine."Another journalist, Juan Arredondo, was also wounded in Ukraine on Sunday.Press freedom groups have denounced the violence journalists are facing while covering the war. The Committee to Protect Journalists, after the death of Renaud, called on Russian forces to "stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once."
7,,London (CNN Business)Russia has sent the clearest signal yet that it will soon default — the first time it will have failed to meet its foreign debt obligations since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago.Half of the country's foreign reserves — roughly $315 billion — have been frozen by Western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said on Sunday. As a result, Moscow will repay creditors from "countries that are unfriendly" in rubles until the sanctions are lifted, he said.Credit ratings agencies would likely consider Russia to be in default if Moscow misses payments or repays debt issued in dollars or euros with other currencies such as the ruble or China's yuan. A default could drive the few remaining foreign investors out of Russia and further isolate the country's crumbling economy. The default could come as early as Wednesday, when Moscow needs to hand over $117 million in interest payments on dollar-denominated government bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase. Although Russia has issued bonds that can be repaid in multiple currencies since 2018, these payments must be made in US dollars.Imminent defaultRead MoreKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Sunday that a Russian default is no longer "improbable.""Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it," she said during an interview on CBS' Face the Nation.Last week, Fitch Ratings downgraded Russian debt, saying Moscow's willingness and ability to service its debts has been undermined and default "is imminent." The ratings agency also warned that Russia may attempt to repay creditors in specified countries in rubles.Analysts at Capital Economics said that a default was already reflected in the price of Russia's dollar bonds, which have crashed to trade at just 20 cents on the dollar.The interest payments due Wednesday come with a 30-day grace period. But credit ratings agencies could declare Russia to be in default before that period ends if Moscow makes clear that it does not intend to pay.Russia last defaulted on its domestic debt when the country was plunged into a financial crisis by a collapse in commodity prices in 1998. Its most recent foreign currency default came in 1918 when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government.What happens nextThe Russian government has borrowed relatively little. JPMorgan estimates that it had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors.But the potential consequences of a default are difficult to gauge. The 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic showed how negative shocks can spread across the modern interconnected global financial system and economy. International banks are owed more than $121 billion by Russian entities, according to the Bank for International Settlements. European banks have over $84 billion total claims, with France, Italy and Austria the most exposed, and US banks owed $14.7 billion.Georgieva said Sunday that a financial crisis was unlikely to develop "for now," saying that the exposure of Western banks was "not systemically relevant."Even if Moscow halts payments to foreign investors on all sovereign debt, the roughly $60 billion default — including ruble debt held overseas — would be in the same ballpark as Argentina's in 2020 — a non-event for markets.But analysts at Capital Economics warned that one major financial institution might be particularly exposed to Russian debt, which could cause broader financial contagion. A second risk is that a default could trigger missed payments by Russian companies.Vladimir Potanin, Russia's richest businessman, called last week for Moscow to ease restrictions on foreign currency so that interest could be paid on foreign bonds and loans. Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion."For Russia, the main cost is being locked out of global capital markets, or at least higher borrowing costs for a prolonged period. But sanctions have done that anyway," wrote analysts at Capital Economics.
8,,New York (CNN Business)US oil prices briefly tumbled below $100 a barrel on Monday, unwinding a significant chunk of the recent spike caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Oil plunged more than 8%, touching a low of $99.76 a barrel. That means oil has lost almost roughly quarter of its value since touching a near 14-year high of $130.50 a barrel on March 6. It's the first time oil has traded below $100 since March 1."This is one hell of a correction," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis.The selloff should ease fears of an energy-driven recession in the United States and, if sustained, should bring some relief to drivers dealing with record gasoline prices. Read MoreBrent crude, the world benchmark, dropped more than 7% to $104.35 a barrel in recent trading. That marks a sharp pullback from the recent peak of nearly $140 a barrel.Uber is rolling out a fuel surchargeTraders blamed Monday's losses on concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns in China and hopes for progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine."You're seeing some vicious selling," said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst of the Americas at Kpler.Despite the recent selling, oil remains up by more than 30% on the year.What this means for gas pricesStill, the tumble back to $100 should cool off prices at the pump, which move with a lag to oil. If oil prices stay at current levels, the national average price for regular gasoline would likely dip by about 20 cents a gallon, Kloza said. That would mean gas prices are still high — and above $4 a gallon nationally — but below record highs.Gas prices have already stopped going straight up, even before Monday's sharp decline in oil. According to AAA, the national average stands at $4.33 a gallon on Monday. That's unchanged from Friday, so things seem to be leveling out — albeit basically at record highs.Why are US gas prices soaring when America barely uses Russian oil?Unfortunately, any relief at the pump may not last long.Kloza still expects gasoline prices to rise this spring and summer as demand recovers, with the national average climbing to around $4.50 a gallon. "It's just going to be a wild ride," Kloza said.Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank, similarly believes oil prices have not yet set their highest levels of the current cycle. "Ultimately, we'll see new highs before all is said and done," said Fitzmaurice. "Given how big and important Russia is, we will probably breach those all-time highs set in 2008."Covid lockdowns in ChinaThe latest leg of the oil selloff came after China locked down Shenzhen, a major technology hub, as well as several other regions to contain its worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years. The lockdowns in China, which has a zero-tolerance Covid policy, raised fears in the energy market about slower demand from the world's No. 2 economy."Coronavirus has taught us you cannot count on a stable outcome," said Kloza. "Just when you think people are going back to normal behavior, here it comes."Oil traders are also watching for developments in the war in Ukraine, including continued negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. A ceasefire could ease fears about a prolonged disruption in oil flows from Russia, the No. 2 oil producer in the world last year. However, energy veterans cautioned against reading too much into the headlines around negotiations between Russia and Ukraine."I am super skeptical about any kind of negotiations having success here, period," said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities. Yawger said even if a ceasefire were to emerge, the West is very unlikely to swiftly remove sanctions on Russia: "Sanctions are not going to disappear anytime soon."
9,,New DelhiIndia may take up a Russian offer to buy crude oil and other commodities at a discount, two Indian officials said, in a sign that Delhi wants to keep its key trading partner on board despite Western attempts to isolate Moscow through sanctions.U.S. officials have said in recent weeks they would like India to distance itself from Russia as much as possible, while recognizing its heavy reliance on Moscow for everything from arms and ammunition to missiles and fighter jets. India has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine and abstained from voting at the United Nations calling out Russia's aggression. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" to demilitarize and "denazify" the country.One person within India's security apparatus said the West understood India's position, given that it needs to keep its armed forces well supplied amid simmering territorial disputes with China.India, which imports 80% of its oil needs, usually buys only about 2% to 3% from Russia. But with oil prices up 40% so far this year, the government is looking at increasing this if it can help reduce its rising energy bill.Read More"Russia is offering oil and other commodities at a heavy discount. We will be happy to take that," one of the Indian government officials said.Russia could default on its debt within daysThe official added that such trade required preparatory work including transportation, insurance cover and getting the right blend of crude, but once that was done India would take Russia up on its offer.The officials, who declined to be identified, did not say how much oil was on offer or what the discount was.The finance ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment.Reuters has reported that Indian officials are trying to set up a rupee-ruble mechanism with Russia to continue bilateral trade. Russia has urged what it describes as friendly nations to maintain trade and investment ties.Apart from oil, India is also looking for cheaper fertilizer from Russia and its ally Belarus, according to one of the officials.'Complicated history'Indian officials said they could not suddenly replace Russia with other suppliers, particularly in the defense sector.India's dependence on Russia for its military hardware still runs as high as 60%, despite a significant reduction over the last decade.U.S. officials have declined to say if India would be sanctioned should Russia send S-400 missile systems as part of a $5.5 billion deal signed in 2018 for five of them.Initial supplies of the system started late last year despite a U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.Ely Ratner, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told a U.S. Congress hearing last week that India was diversifying its defense suppliers."We recognize that India has a complicated history and relationship with Russia. The majority of the weapons that they buy are from the Russians," he said."The good news is that they are in a multi-year process of diversifying their arms purchases away from Russia -- that's going to take some time. But they are clearly committed to doing that, including the indigenization of their own defense industry and that's something we should support."British Foreign Minister Liz Truss also said last week that London should pursue closer economic and defense ties with India to help it reduce its reliance on Russia.Since 2011, New Delhi has cut its defense imports from Russia by 53%.D. Bala Venkatesh Varma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, said New Delhi should not be expected to pay a price for a standoff between global powers."This is not a fight we have created," he told an online seminar on Monday.
10,,Japanese authorities ordered crypto exchanges on Monday not to process transactions involving crypto assets subject to asset-freeze sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the war in Ukraine.The step was taken after a Group of Seven (G7) statement on Friday that said Western nations "will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth."There are growing concerns among G7 advanced economies that cryptocurrencies are being used by Russian entities as a loophole for financial sanctions imposed upon the country for invading Ukraine.The US Treasury Department issued new guidance on Friday that required US-based cryptocurrency firms not to engage in transactions with sanction targets."We decided to make an announcement to keep the G7 momentum alive," said a senior official at Japan's Financial Services Agency. "The sooner the better."Read MoreCoinbase, Binance resist calls to kick Russians off crypto platformsThe Japanese government will strengthen measures against the transfer of funds using crypto assets that would violate the sanctions, the FSA and the Ministry of Finance said in a joint statement.Japan has lagged a global shift among financial regulators in setting stricter rules on private digital currencies, while the G7 rich powers and the Group of 20 powerhouses have all called for greater regulation of "stablecoins."Unauthorized payments to targets under sanctions, including through crypto assets, are subject to punishment of up to three years in prison or a 1 million yen ($8,487.52) fine, the FSA said on Monday.There were 31 crypto exchanges in Japan as of March 4, according to an industry association.Global regulators remain concerned about the safety of the new market for investors, given its surge in popularity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has cited the potential for market manipulation as one of the primary reasons for rejecting several applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
11,,New York (CNNBusiness)As Russia's assault in Ukraine intensifies, fear of radioactive fallout from accidental or intentional attacks on Ukraine's nuclear plants, or from the use of a nuclear bomb, has triggered surging demand for potassium iodide pills.In such an event, there's the frightening risk of large amounts of radioactive iodine (or radioiodine) being released into the atmosphere which can be breathed into lungs as well as contaminate water, soil, plants and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although potassium iodide itself isn't harmful and is an important chemical that's needed by the human body, the CDC says radioactive iodide can harm the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that produces many of the hormones that regulate the body. The danger is that if radiation exposure occurs, the thyroid gland can't distinguish between regular iodine and radioiodine and will absorb both. Too much exposure can lead to thyroid cancer. When used as directed, potassium iodide in liquid or pill form can quickly saturate the thyroid gland and prevent it from absorbing radioactive iodine. Read MorePrice gouging sets in Large manufacturers of potassium iodide approved for sale in the United Sates have seen their inventories rapidly depleted in recent weeks, coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.As supplies in the market dry up, price gouging has set in.On eBay (EBAY), four boxes of Thyrosafe potassium iodide tablets were listed for $132.50 on Monday. Another listing for a box of IOSAT 130 mg pills was selling for $89.95 each. The 14-pack box of the IOSAT tablets, made by Anbex, sell for $13.99 on the manufacturer's website.Anbex is hoping to restock its inventory of IOSAT potassium Iodide tablets in the coming weeks.It's also important to know that potassium iodide pills aren't a cure-all and don't offer 100% protection against radioactive iodine. The CDC warns that a single dose protects the thyroid gland for just 24 hours.The agency said taking a higher dose, or taking it more often than recommended, does not offer more protection and can cause severe illness or death.The CDC also cautions that potassium iodide pills only protect the thyroid and work best for certain age groups.Out of stockAnbex, Inc., based in New York, is a leading supplier and produces 65 mg and 130 mg IOSAT potassium iodide tablets. Its website currently shows a message saying, "We are currently out of stock of IOSAT potassium iodide 130mg and 65mg tablets.""We hope to be back in stock in early April but we're pushing for late March," said Troy Jones, vice president of sales and marketing for Anbex. Jones also runs a website www.nukepills.com that sells Anbex's potassium iodide pills.Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctionsJones said the company saw a rush of orders beginning in mid February of up to 15 million tablets from a variety of buyers, including individuals, resellers, hospitals, municipalities and governments worldwide."The big run started on February 23 through February 28. We sold out of all the inventory we had," Jones said. Although supplies are being replenished weekly, they're selling out just as fast. "In the past five days we've probably sold as much as what typically would take us half a year to sell," he added.The timeline, Jones said, matched reports last month that Russian forces had seized control of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The plant's electrical system was reportedly damaged during the attack and required repair work.Russia could default on its debt within daysHistorically, demand for potassium iodide spikes when there's a real or perceived threat of nuclear fallout, Jones said.Demand soared when former President Donald Trump tweeted in 2018 that he had a "much bigger & more powerful" button than North Korea's Kim Jong-un, igniting fear about an escalating threat of nuclear war. It also happened in the same year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent out a false ballistic missile alert.And just last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he had ordered his country's deterrence forces — which include nuclear arms — to be at their highest state of alert. The White House responded to the move, calling it part of a wider pattern of unprovoked escalations and "manufactured threats" from the Kremlin. The escalating rhetoric from Russia only helped fuel anxiety — and the purchase of potassium iodide, manufacturers said.Anbex, which sells its tablets in a 14- day or 20-day foil-sealed pack depending on the dosage, has ramped up production, said Jones. He said consumers should follow the CDC's guidelines and only take potassium iodide pills on the advice of health officials.BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said demand for its Thyrosafe pills took off in February coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.London-based BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it's also experiencing heightened demand for the company's potassium iodide products across Europe and the US.  "This has coincided with the conflict in Ukraine," said Chris Sampson, spokesperson for London-based BTG, which also has US operations. BTG makes Thyrosafe, an FDA-appoved 65 mg over-the-counter potassium iodide tablet. A box of 20 tablets is priced at $12.95 on the company's website.Sampson said BTG has not been entirely out of stock, "though we have temporarily stopped accepting orders through our own website and some of our partners/distributors have been out of stock.""Most of our product is sold to governments, public health agencies and the military who manage stockpiles," he said. "All of those orders are being met." The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on this story.-- CNN's Brenda Goodman contributed to this report
12,,(CNN Business)A digital Iron Curtain may be descending on Russia, as President Vladimir Putin struggles to control the narrative about his war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has already moved to block Facebook and Twitter, and its latest step in that direction came Friday as the government announced plans to block Instagram in the country, as well. But despite Putin's efforts to clamp down on social media and information within his borders, a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to access outside sources and circumvent the Kremlin's restrictions.  To defeat Russia's internet censorship, many are turning to specialized circumvention technology that's been widely used in other countries with restricted online freedoms, including China and Iran. Digital rights experts say Putin may have inadvertently sparked a massive, permanent shift in digital literacy in Russia that will work against the regime for years. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russians have been flocking to virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted messaging apps, tools that can be used to access blocked websites such as Facebook or safely share news about the war in Ukraine without running afoul of new, draconian laws banning what Russian authorities consider to be "fake" claims about the conflict.  A rapid rise in downloads Read MoreDuring the week of February 28, Russian internet users downloaded the five leading VPN apps on Apple and Google's app stores a total of 2.7 million times, a nearly three-fold increase in demand compared to the week before, according to the market research firm SensorTower.  That growth dovetails with what some VPN providers have reported. Switzerland-based Proton, for example, told CNN Business it has seen a 1,000% spike in signups from Russia this month. (The company declined to provide a baseline figure for comparison, however.)  VPN providers are just one type of application seeing higher uptake in Russia. Since March 1, a range of messaging apps including Meta's Messenger and WhatsApp services have seen a gradual increase in traffic, said the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, a trend consistent with an increase in traffic to global social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.  But perhaps the fastest-growing messaging app in Russia may be the encrypted messaging app Signal. SensorTower said Signal was downloaded 132,000 times in the country last week, an increase of more than 28% from the week before. Russian internet traffic to Signal has seen "significant growth" since March 1, Cloudflare told CNN Business. Other private messaging apps, such as Telegram, saw a relative slowdown in growth that week but still witnessed more than half a million downloads in that timeframe, SensorTower said. In recent weeks, Russian internet users also appear to have increased their reliance on Tor, a service that anonymizes internet browsing by scrambling a user's traffic and bouncing it through multiple servers around the world. Beginning the day of the Ukraine invasion, Tor's metrics page estimated that thousands more Russian users were accessing the web through secret servers connected to Tor's decentralized network. Tor users got a helping hand from Twitter on Tuesday, as the social network — which has been partially blocked in Russia following the invasion — added the ability to access its platform through a specialized website designed for Tor users. Facebook, for its part, has had its own Tor site since 2014.  And Lantern, a peer-to-peer tool that routes internet traffic around government firewalls, began seeing more downloads from Russia starting about two months ago, said Sascha Meinrath, a communications professor at Penn State University who sits on the board of Lantern's parent company, Brave New Software.  Lantern has seen a 2,000% increase in downloads from Russia alone over the past two months, Meinrath said, with the service going from 5,000 monthly users in Russia to more than 120,000. By comparison, Meinrath said, Lantern has between 2 million and 3 million users globally, mostly in China and Iran. "Tor, Lantern, all the VPNs, anything that's masking who you are or where you're going —Telegram — everything, downloads are increasing dramatically," said Meinrath. "And it's a bootstrapping thing, so the people that are on Telegram, they're using that to swap notes about what else you should download." The most tech-savvy and privacy-conscious users, said Meinrath, know how to combine multiple tools together to maximize their protection — for example, by using Lantern to get around government blocks while also using Tor to anonymize their activity.  The war for information technology The growing prominence of some of these tools highlights the stakes for Russian internet users as the Kremlin has detained thousands of people for protesting the war in Ukraine. And it contrasts with the steps Russia has taken to clamp down on social media, from blocking Facebook entirely to passing a law that threatens up to 15 years behind bars for those who share what the Kremlin deems "fake" information about the war.  Natalia Krapiva, a lawyer at the digital rights group Access Now, said some Russian internet users have been using secure communications tools for years, as the Russian government began restricting internet freedoms more than a decade ago.  In the past, the Russian government has tried to block Tor and VPN providers, Krapiva said. But it hasn't been very successful, she said, due to Tor's open, decentralized design that hinges on many distributed servers and the willingness of new VPN providers to fill the gap left behind by banned ones. What Russia faces now is an intensifying game of cat and mouse, Krapiva said.  But while Putin may not be able to shut down censorship-resistant technologies entirely, supporters of the Kremlin can still try to drag it into Russia's wider information war and hinder adoption.  On February. 28, Signal said it was aware of rumors suggesting the platform had been compromised in a hack — a claim the company flatly denied. Without blaming Russia directly, Signal said it suspected the rumors were being spread as "part of a coordinated misinformation campaign meant to encourage people to use less secure alternatives." Signal's claim underscores how quickly the information war has evolved from being about the news coming out of Ukraine to being about the services people use to access and discuss that news. If only a small minority of Russians end up embracing circumvention technologies to get access to outside information, it may allow Putin to dominate the information space within the country. And while there are many indications of growing interest in these tools, it appears to be on the scale of thousands, not millions, at least for now.  "The concern, of course, is that the majority of the people, the general population, might not necessarily know about those tools," said Krapiva. "[They] can be complex if your digital literacy is quite low, so it's going to remain a challenge to have a bigger section of the population really adopt these tools. But I'm sure there will be more education and I want to remain hopeful they will persevere." Normalizing censorship-resistant tech  Some digital rights experts say it's important for these tools to be used for ordinary and innocuous internet activities, too, not just potentially subversive ones. Performing mundane tasks like checking email, accessing streaming movies or talking to friends using these technologies makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to justify cracking down on them, and can make it more difficult to identify efforts to violate government restrictions on speech and access. "The more that regular users use censorship-resistant technology for everyday activities like unblocking movies, the better," said John Scott-Railton, a security and disinformation researcher at The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. And this may only be the start. Meinrath said the government restrictions will likely trigger not just broader adoption of circumvention tools in Russia but also further research and development of new tools by Russia's highly skilled and tech-savvy population.  "We're at the beginning of a J-curve," Meinrath said, adding: "This is a one-way transformation in Russia."
13,,(CNN Business)Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a reminder on Sunday that it prohibits calls on its platforms for the assassination of high-ranking world leaders, following intense scrutiny of the company's decision last week to relax hate speech policies in Ukraine.In an internal post to employees, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said "we do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state." Russia opens criminal case against Meta following temporary hate speech policy changeThe internal post, which was reported by Bloomberg and Reuters and confirmed to CNN Business by a Meta spokesperson, does not mention Russian President Vladimir Putin by name. The spokesperson affirmed that the restrictions on calls for assassination apply globally. Meta's earlier decision allows Ukrainian users to post otherwise prohibited calls for violent self-defense or condemnation of Russia's invasion, and effectively created more leeway for users in the country to express support for violence on Meta's platforms. (On Sunday, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation thanked Meta and said the decision "respect[ed] our right to counter the aggression" from Russia.)But Meta was forced to clarify its stance after Russia accused it of facilitating "illegal calls for murder and violence" against Russian citizens and opened a criminal case against the company. Russia has separately moved to block Facebook and Instagram in the country as part of a crackdown on information about the war in Ukraine, though a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to circumvent the ban.  Read MoreThe Ukraine-specific policy on hate speech, which is temporary, is "focused on protecting people's rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country," Clegg said in a public statement Friday. The statement added that Meta has "no quarrel with the Russian people" and that "there is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned."Clegg's internal post on Sunday doubled down on that position."We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general," Clegg wrote, adding that the hate-speech carveout for Ukraine applies only to speech "regarding the Russian military invasion."

15,,(CNN Business)Dozens of the world's biggest companies have abandoned or scaled back their operations in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The exodus affects every corner of the economy, from its vast energy riches through autos, finance, retail, entertainment and fast food, starving Russia of new investment and removing products and services that had become popular in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Here's a look at the major corporate departures. AutosFord (F) announced it was suspending its operations in Russia. The American automaker has a 50% stake in Ford Sollers, a joint venture that employs at least 4,000 workers and is shared with Russian company Sollers.Read MoreA Ford dealership and service center. The company has plants in St. Petersburg, Elabuga and Naberezhnye Chelny but said it had "significantly wound down" its Russian operations in recent years. The automaker said it was "deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine," and noted it has "a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working at Ford around the world."General Motors (GM) said it was halting all exports to Russia "until further notice."GM doesn't have a significant presence there: It sells only about 3,000 vehicles a year through 16 dealerships, according to a spokesperson. That's out of the more than 6 million vehicles the Detroit-based automaker sells annually.Toyota (TM) announced it would stop making cars in Russia or importing them to the country "until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions."Volkswagen (VLKAF) is stopping production of vehicles in Russia and has suspended exports to the Russian market. The decision applies to the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod.Nissan (NSANF) has suspended the export of vehicles to Russia, adding that it "anticipates that production will stop soon at our plant in St. Petersburg."AviationBoeing (BA) said it would suspend support for Russian airlines.A company spokesperson confirmed the aircraft maker was pausing "parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines," and had also "suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv."Airbus (EADSF) followed Boeing with a similar move. In a statement, the company said it has "suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country."Big TechAirbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that his company was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.Amazon's (AMZN) cloud division, Amazon Web Services, said March 8 it would halt new sign-ups for the service in Russia and Belarus. The company has already had a "long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government" and does not have data centers, infrastructure or offices in Russia, the company said in a blog post."AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services," Amazon said. "Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended."Apple (AAPL) has stopped selling its products in Russia.The tech giant said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned" about the Russian invasion. In response, the company has also moved to limit access to digital services, such as Apple Pay, inside Russia, and restricted the availability of Russian state media applications outside the country.A re:Store shop in central Moscow. re:Store is one of the largest Apple resellers in Russia.Facebook (FB)-parent Meta said it would block access to Russian news outlets Sputnik and RT, the Russia-backed television network infamous for promoting Russian President Vladimir Putin's agenda, across the European Union. The move comes after the company received "requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media," Nick Clegg, Meta's VP of global affairs, wrote in a tweet.Meta has also said it has applied algorithmic restrictions on Russian state media that should prevent those posts from surfacing as prominently in users' feeds.Hitachi (HTHIY) said March 10 that it is pausing exports to Russia and suspending all manufacturing in the country, "with the exception of products, services and support for electrical power equipment that are indispensable to the daily lives of people," it said.The Japanese conglomerate added that Russia accounts for just a small fraction — roughly 0.5% — of its revenue.IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has suspended all business in Russia."In Ukraine, we have been in constant touch with our local teams and continue to provide assistance that includes relocation and financial support," Krishna said. "The safety and security of IBMers and their families in all areas impacted by this crisis remains our top priority."Big Tech cracks down on Russian state media content amid mounting pressureIntel (INTC) has stopped all shipments to Russia and Belarus, the company announced. Microsoft (MSFT) said it was suspending all new sales of its products and services in Russia. President and vice-chair Brad Smith also said the company is stopping "many aspects" of its business in Russia in compliance with government sanctions. Microsoft also said it will continue aiding in Ukrainian cybersecurity. Netflix (NFLX) said it will be suspending its streaming service in Russia."Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia," a Netflix spokesperson told CNN.No other details were provided.Previously, the company said it was refusing to air Russian state TV channels — something that the platform would have been required to do starting this week under Russian law."Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service," the company told CNN Business.Nintendo (NTDOF) has stopped taking online orders in Russia.In a statement on its Russian website, the Switch console maker said that it had "suspended the processing of payments in rubles," and temporarily set its digital store on "maintenance mode."Roku (ROKU), which sells hardware allowing users to stream content through the internet, has banned RT worldwide.Russia tries to stop Western companies fleeing the countrySony (SNE) has halted all software and hardware shipments, and temporarily suspended orders on its online PlayStation store in Russia.The entertainment giant has also paused plans to launch Gran Turismo 7, a driving simulator game, in the country. Sony "joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine," it said in a statement.Spotify (SPOT) said it has closed its office in Russia "indefinitely" and restricted shows "owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media." The streaming service removed all content from RT and Sputnik in Europe and other regions, a company spokesman said. "We are deeply shocked and saddened by the unprovoked attack on Ukraine," the spokesman added. "Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever."Twitter (TWTR) has similarly announced plans to "reduce the visibility and amplification" of Russian state media content.YouTube, which is owned by Google (GOOGL), said it blocked Russian state media within Ukraine, including RT.

16,,(CNN Business)Big tech platforms have joined the global backlash against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Spotify (SPOT), Netflix (NFLX) and others placing at least partial restrictions on Russian content — if not exiting (or getting themselves blocked) altogether. In the past week, however, the severing of Russia from the global internet went one layer deeper. Two of the world's largest internet service providers, Lumen Technologies and Cogent Communications, said they would block Russian customers from their networks over fears that their networks could be used by the Russian government for cyberattacks against the West. But a knock-on effect is that it will be even harder for citizens in the country to use the worldwide web. The move highlights the tension over Russia's effort to erect what's being called a digital Iron Curtain to close its citizens off from outside information, much like China has done for years. Companies find themselves caught between helping Russians freely access the internet and ensuring their services are not used by the Russian government to spread disinformation, propaganda or worse. The implications are massive. Lumen and Cogent collectively preside over nearly 600,000 miles of optical fiber that forms the piping for the global internet, with each boasting operations in more than 50 countries, according to their websites.Fear of cyberattacksRead MoreBoth companies insist their moves were squarely directed at the Russian government and not the Russian people, and any impediment to the latter's ability to access outside information is an unfortunate side effect. "We as a company are a very strong believer in an open and uncensored internet," Dave Schaeffer, Cogent's CEO, said in an interview with CNN Business. "This was a very difficult decision." Cogent Communications CEO Dave SchaefferAccording to Schaeffer, cutting Russia off is a preventative measure against cyberattacks that may be perpetrated through Cogent's network by the Russian government or individuals linked to it. The company, which is based in Washington D.C., has limited its action to around 25 customers that are incorporated in Russia and are directly on Russian networks, he said. That means Russian businesses that use Cogent's network outside the country through non-Russian state entities can continue to do so."We felt that the downside of having the possibility that these connections could be used offensively outweighed the negative of terminating some services," he added.An unprecedented decisionLumen, headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, cited similar reasoning for its decision, which came a few days after Cogent's. "We decided to disconnect the network due to increased security risk inside Russia," Mark Molzen, the company's global issues director, said in an email. "We have not yet experienced network disruptions but given the increasingly uncertain environment and the heightened risk of state action, we took this move to ensure the security of our and our customers' networks, as well as the ongoing integrity of the global Internet."The digital Iron Curtain: How Russia's internet could soon start to look a lot like China'sIt's also an unprecedented decision in some ways. Schaeffer said Cogent has previously taken down certain websites and addresses at the requests of governments in several countries, including Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States, as long as the requests have a lawful basis. "This is different," he said, describing it as the first time the company has made a proactive move. "We don't look inside of our customers' pipes, what they do with them is their business. In this case, we terminated the entire pipe." Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the location of Lumen Technologies' headquarters. The company is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana.
17,,London (CNN Business)Nazmin Begum has a problem: she's having to pay much more to keep her two children warm and fed as the United Kingdom endures its worst cost of living crisis in three decades."Everything's increasing," she told CNN Business during a visit to The Boiler House, which provides discounted food, footwear and fuel vouchers from a red brick building on a public housing estate in east London. Begum's energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about £70 ($92) in the past three months, even though she's using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen "every single product" rise in price."Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that's gone to £1 ($1.31)," she said. "The bread — the cheapest bread that we used to do for £1 — has gone to £1.20 ($1.57)." Annual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom — its highest level since 1992 — fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren't keeping pace.  Read MoreAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher —  gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.The Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London.The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a £6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about £35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. But the charity's services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. "Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don't get ill?" she said. "Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they're not hungry?"Millions of people's fuel bills rose in October when Britain's energy regulator increased its consumer price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy — by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.A shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13.On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to £49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  "You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down," she said. 'There's just nothing left to give'The worst is yet to come.In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% — its largest ever rise — burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly £2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. Steam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London.The higher costs could push the number of "destitute" households — defined as those unable to afford basic necessities — up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons' annual energy bills after October — the next time the price cap is adjusted — could rocket past £3,000 ($3,927) as a result. "Now there's just nothing left to give from people's budgets. There's no way the numbers add up now," Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business."Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on," she added. "They're really kind of taking on that stress that they're seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack."The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was "providing support worth around £12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living."The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than £1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.Critics say the government's response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is "alarming." He said the government's plan to delay energy payments won't help vulnerable people."We're appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan," he told CNN Business. "A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there's then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking."People march through  Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living.Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. "It's just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us," Allinson said. Paychecks can't keep upAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people's doors. Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   Volunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food."It's all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything," Moseley said. "It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying."Moseley receives Universal Credit — a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by £20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that's less than half the expected rate of inflation.Rising wages can't keep up either. The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. "We're seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly," CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. "When the actual money comes, it's not enough," she added.Parents are 'dreading' SeptemberSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos — mandatory in the United Kingdom — can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children's Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 — clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is "dreading" the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic. "I can't afford £100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay £50 ($65), £60 ($79) for a school blazer?" she said.Back at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal's Shoes. Begum's daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on. "With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you're just effectively being handed handouts," said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal's Shoes.Sal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16.Its three pop-up stores around the country aim to give "families a shopping experience," she said. "So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes — but they don't have to pay."Sal's Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever. Bowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support."We have headteachers who've done playground duty and then ring us because they've literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes," she said. 'Hardship is harder'The Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around. For people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments. Joseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother's funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.  "This is the parts of life that people aren't seeing," he said. "We're locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we're struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates — because we're having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by." For over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis."Hardship is harder," he said.
18,,New York (CNN Business)Starbucks has a love-hate relationship with its cups. The company's white — or sometimes holiday-themed — logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that's not entirely a good thing. "Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that," said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. "But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society." That's because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option — recyclable items still end up in landfills.The best solution? "Eliminating the disposable cup," Kobori said. He called that option "the holy grail."The traditional Starbucks disposable cup.Read MoreBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. The goals don't mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won't be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. Testing out Borrow-A-Cup programs  Examples of Starbucks' reusable cups. To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. "I think that will take the lead," she said. "We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe," including "20 different iterations and in eight different markets." In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year."We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups," Landers explained. For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  "The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees]," she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough — they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn't have to worry about that part of the process. Starbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The model is the most promising because it's the easiest to integrate into customers' daily lives. You don't have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don't need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don't have time for on a weekday morning. But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. Bringing back the personal cup  Starbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. "We're testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today — from 10 cents to 50 cents," Landers said. "We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee." She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. That's simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks' drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. "We've got mock stores set up," said Landers. "We have different versions of the drive-thru layout." Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. Pantene and Stubb's will be sold in reusable containers at some Kroger storesOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. The team is trying "different things, over and over again," to figure out what might work, she said. "We're right now in the middle of all of that work."It's crucial for Starbucks' mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. That's especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company's  leadership. A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.If the company's initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement."We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don't change their behavior all that easily," Landers said. "Even though they really, really want to."
19,,Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's economy started the year on a bright note, with several major indicators beating forecasts. But as Covid cases in the country spike, keeping up the same pace of growth in the coming months may prove difficult.Retail sales rose 6.7% in the first two months of 2022 compared to a year ago, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday. That was well above the estimated 3% increase in a Reuters poll of economists.Industrial production jumped 7.5% during the same period, surpassing the forecast of 3.9%. And investment in fixed assets, such as infrastructure and machinery, jumped 12.2% from a year earlier."Under the combined effect of macro policies and the efforts of businesses, the momentum of China's economic recovery has improved in January and February, laying a solid foundation for a good start in the first quarter of this year,"  said Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, at a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.On the policy front, China has significantly boosted its spending on infrastructure, with many local governments kicking off big projects in areas such as electric mobility and semiconductors, Fu added.Read MoreTuesday's data showed that investment in manufacturing surged 21% during January and February from a year ago, much faster than the 13.5% year-on-year growth recorded in the same period in 2021. China sets lowest economic growth target in decades as challenges mountThis is not the first time this year that Chinese authorities have underscored the importance of infrastructure expenditure. Earlier this month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the government would ramp up fiscal and monetary support for the economy this year, including spending more on infrastructure and conducting more interest rate cuts. The government has increased the broad fiscal deficit this year, implying growth in infrastructure investment, wrote Larry Hu, chief economist for Greater China at Macquarie Group, in a report on Tuesday. However, experts warn that there are multiple challenges on the horizon, including Covid and the war in Ukraine.China's new Covid lockdowns are another threat to the economyThe worst Covid-19 surge in two yearsChina is fighting its worst Covid surge since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020."With officials ditching targeted containment measures in favor of wholesale lockdowns, this has the potential to be even more disruptive than the Delta wave last Summer, which led to a sharp contraction in economic output," wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, on Tuesday. Even the government acknowledges that new Covid outbreaks could weigh on the economy in the coming months."The recent spread of the coronavirus in many parts of the country may restrict consumption further, and the foundation of the consumption is still not strong," Fu said. "Sporadic outbreaks in some regions will also affect industrial growth."China reported 5,154 locally transmitted cases on Monday, the highest number in two years, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).To contain the spread of the virus, authorities have taken strict measures in multiple cities and placed tens of millions of people under various forms of lockdowns.Apple supplier Foxconn halts operations in Shenzhen as China locks down tech hubThe southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has imposed a week-long lockdown since Monday. All businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operations or have implemented work-from-home policies. The city is home to Chinese tech giants Huawei and Tencent.Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities in the northeastern province of Jilin have banned residents from leaving or traveling since Monday. The province, with 24 million people, is home to the industrial hub of Changchun, where Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) run their car factories in partnership with state-owned car maker FAW Group.Shanghai, the country's largest business center, has also imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city."Indeed, Covid-19 is the biggest uncertainty this year," Hu from Macquarie Group said.He predicts that China will grow at 4% in the current quarter. For 2022, he expects the world's second largest economy to grow at 5%, lower than the government's target. Earlier this month, Premier Li set China's economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades.Inflation pressure from the Ukraine crisis China growth may be hit even further by the war in Ukraine.Russia's invasion of its neighbor is pushing up commodity prices and roiling the global economy, at a time when policymakers are already racing to get high inflation under control. Fu from the NBS said the direct impact of the tensions in Europe on China is "limited," as its trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine is "small."But he said the impact on global commodity prices is "obvious," which could increase the pressure of "imported inflation" on China.Several food and beverage companies in China have recently hiked prices of their products, including dairy giants Yili and Mengniu."The recent acceleration in commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the margin pressure on packaged food companies," analysts from Morningstar wrote in a report on Tuesday. "Various food and beverage companies in China have engaged in price hikes since the third quarter last year to mitigate margin compression." Analysis: China can't do much to help Russia's sanction-hit economyChina and Russia have forged close ties in recent years, and signed a number of commodities deals during Russian President Putin's visit to Beijing last month. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put their friendship to the test. Beijing has not rushed to help Russia after the latter's economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. The complicated messaging from Beijing suggests Chinese leaders are walking "a very difficult tightrope" on Ukraine, analysts say.
20,,Hong Kong (CNN Business)Maria was just about to start a new job as a domestic worker in Hong Kong last month when she found out she had Covid-19.She immediately told her employer, who urged her to get to a hospital. But once she was there, she said she was turned away, with staffers explaining there was no room. They advised her to go home and quarantine.The problem? Her place of work was her home and "my employer didn't want me to come back," said Maria, noting that they had "kids in the house." "I said, 'I don't know where I can go. We don't have a place,'" she told CNN Business, breaking into tears. She asked not to publish her real name, for fear of reprisals from current or future employers, and to not worry her family abroad. CNN Business agreed to call her "Maria." Foreign domestic workers are required to live with their employers in Hong Kong, under a longstanding government mandate that has been contested for years.Read MoreMaria, who is from the Philippines, returned to the hospital, where she spent the night sleeping on a chair in the emergency room, along with a friend in a similar situation. But the next day, they were told by a nurse more expressly to "go away," she said.Not knowing what else to do, they set up camp on the street. In recent weeks, dozens of domestic workers have been cast out on the streets in Hong Kong after testing positive for Covid-19. One worker, not pictured here, said she was not allowed home with her employer over fears of contagion."We cannot express what [we] feel [at] that time — just crying only," said Maria.Maria and her friend eventually found a shelter to stay in, run by the charity HELP for Domestic Workers. Maria is one of dozens of migrant domestic workers who have been abandoned — and temporarily made homeless — in Hong Kong after testing positive for the coronavirus, according to the charity.  Her story, and others like it, shine a light on deep-seated inequalities in the city that are worsening under a devastating fifth wave of Covid-19.

And while some expatriates can command higher salaries for simply agreeing to move to the city, the city's poorest are struggling just to afford food or basic necessities.Heading for the exitsThe widening gap comes at a time when Hong Kong is facing an exodus of expats, despite the additional benefits on offer, which continues to raise questions about its future as a global business hub.Many foreigners have had enough of the city's unwavering commitment to its "zero Covid" policy, even as cases surge to record highs and cause more fatalities, overloading the health care system and delivering a huge punch to the economy. Throughout 2020 and 2021, more residents left Hong Kong than came in, according to official population statistics. That marked a reversal from early 2019, when the population was going up. Last month alone, more than 94,000 people departed the city, while only about 23,000 came in, immigration data showed.Hong Kong expats are up in arms about quarantine. Singapore stands to gain"The recent wave of emigration is leading to a shortage of skilled workers and impacting businesses of all sizes," the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement earlier this month.The group's chairman, Peter Wong, said the city was "facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.""This will have a material knock-on impact on the economy," he added. "There is real cause for concern if we cannot stem the current brain drain."The city has been largely sealed off from the rest of the world for the last two years, in part because most inbound travelers must quarantine in hotel rooms at their own expense for two weeks. Previously, the requirement was for three weeks. Hong Kong is sticking to zero-Covid, no matter what the costThe issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now. Last month, Mandarin Oriental (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a "very, very poor" base due to the restrictions.According to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.Last year, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.Hong Kong kept out Covid, but exhausted and depressed pilots are paying the priceFrench spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.In November, FedEx (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city's "pandemic requirements."From the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data. Asked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that "Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies."The representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as "a market of 86 million people." Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years. The government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently "risen to a record high of 9,049."But the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year. BASF (BASFY), a German chemicals giant, recently relocated its chief for Asia Pacific, excluding Greater China, to Singapore "after careful consideration of her office's strategic location in the region," according to the company.The decision was based on "the requirement for proximity to relevant stakeholders and markets," it told CNN Business in a statement.More than 40% of expats in a survey are thinking of leaving Hong KongOthers may be biding their time. Hong Kong recently brought forward the end of the school year for some institutions to March or April, giving families more time to reevaluate their options before the new term begins in September.In some sectors, bonus season typically takes place around this period, too."I suspect there's a lot of international bankers who may be waiting till then before they decide whether they've had their fill of Hong Kong," said a person working in the finance industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.Free flights and country clubsThis exodus means that top companies in the city are working extra hard to attract — and retain — skilled workers. Two senior headhunters in Hong Kong said that job candidates were increasingly pricing in the inconvenience of living in the city — if they were even persuaded to do so."Most of them are just kind of immediately saying no," said John Mullally, regional director of Southern China and Hong Kong financial services at recruitment agency Robert Walters. "You've got a smaller candidate pool, especially when it comes to those with overseas experience."Mark Tibbatts, managing director of Southern China and Taiwan for the agency Michael Page, described it as "an ongoing battle" that had made it "nigh on impossible" to lure international talent.A view of Hong Kong's skyline, captured on Wednesday.The circumstances have revived the so-called "expat package," which had mostly been scrapped in recent years, according to both recruiters."Let's go back a couple of decades. Most of the senior expats in Hong Kong were on a pretty juicy package that might have included flights home, and education, and club memberships and all these types of things," said Tibbatts. "Over the last, let's say, 10, 15 years, most of that's been phased out."Alibaba co-founder: Jack Ma is doing well and Hong Kong will be 'fine'Now, some of those deals are "coming back," he added.Mullally also described a rising view that Hong Kong was becoming "a bit of a hardship posting" for expats, a term that typically refers to a place with hostile living conditions.That perception was more common from the 1970s to early 1990s, and back then justified more perks for businesspeople, he said.Now, companies are "going to have to try to bring that back because ... realistically, if you want to attract people, that's kind of the package you'll have to put together."Nowhere to goAs international executives jump ship, blue-collar workers and the city's poorest are being left behind to face the darkening economic outlook. It's not just in Hong Kong: Inequality around the world has worsened throughout the pandemic, with billionaires making unprecedented gains in wealth as tens of millions of people fall into poverty. Despite a growing shortage of domestic workers in Hong Kong, "it is not easy to say whether [the pandemic] has as a whole positively or negatively impacted them," said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers."We definitely have seen a number of domestic workers who are being offered higher than statutorily mandated wages due to the shortage of incoming domestic workers," she said.JUST WATCHEDHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizensReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizens 02:51"But we have also seen domestic workers being forced to take on salaries lower than the minimum allowable wage ... there is a power imbalance." From January 2020 to the end of 2021, the city's number of domestic workers dropped from more than 400,000 to roughly 340,000, according to government statistics. In a recent blog post, Hong Kong Labor Secretary Law Chi-kwong pointed to flight bans from certain countries as a possible reason for the slump, saying that some workers had likely been stranded abroad.When asked about the plight of domestic workers, authorities told CNN Business that foreign workers who test positive for Covid-19 "will receive support and medical treatment like local people in Hong Kong." And, if unemployed, they will be admitted to community isolation facilities, they said. A government spokesperson also said that it "has continuously reminded employers of their statutory obligations and requirements" during the pandemic, and "any breach of such requirements will render them ineligible to employ [a domestic worker] for a period of time." 'Zero income'While big international firms may have the privilege to up and move, most local businesses have no choice but to hunker down.As many as 50,000 small businesses could shut down over the city's fifth wave of Covid, estimates Danny Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association.That's about one in seven such registered entities across the city — and there could be more, he said.Despite soaring infections, Hong Kong officials have been holding onto the "zero Covid" strategy in recent weeks, introducing social distancing restrictions that have stifled local activity.

Zero income," Lau said of those business owners. He added that some had resorted to operating secretly just to keep making a living.Like elsewhere, small businesses had already been hit hard earlier in the pandemic, especially by the lack of tourists.These firms were "almost half dead," said Lau, noting that some entrepreneurs had already taken out significant loans or dug into their reserves just to stay afloat."The worst thing is you cannot see the future," he added. "We don't know how long these restrictions will last for."
21,,Hong Kong (CNN Business)Foxconn, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, has suspended operations in Shenzhen as China locks down the technology hub and several other regions to contain the country's worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years.The world's second largest economy is still doggedly pursuing its zero-Covid strategy, even as other nations reopen and try to live with the virus. The lockdowns in major Chinese cities will impact not just the country's post-pandemic recovery, but could deliver a new blow to global supply chains.The southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, is home to Chinese tech giants like Tencent (TCEHY) and Huawei. It imposed a week-long lockdown starting Monday, after recording 66 positive cases Saturday.In its statement provided to CNN Business on Monday, Foxconn said that the "date of factory resumption is to be advised by the local government."Foxconn has two major campuses in Shenzhen. The Taiwanese company has "adjusted" its production line to other sites to "minimize the potential impact" from the disruption, it added.

In Shenzhen, all businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operation or have implemented work-from-home policies. Public transportation, including subways and buses, have been suspended in the city, which has a population of 17.5 million.Shenzhen is also home to one of the world's largest container ports, and any disruption there could hit an already stressed out global supply chain. Last summer, the Yantian port in Shenzhen was forced to shut down for nearly a week after infections were found among dock workers, causing a massive backlog of goods that took months to clear and a spike in global freight rates. So far the port continues to operate.Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday. Tencent sank 9.8%. Telecoms firm ZTE (ZTCOF) lost 7%. BYD (BYDDF), China's largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%.

22,,New York (CNN Business)Surging oil and gas prices have raised recession alarm bells around the world. But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.Wall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury. As that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%. The gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.Inverted yield curve often occurs before recessionsRead MoreAn inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN's Poppy Harlow that a recession is "a real likelihood" but he added that "we have a very strong economy" and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.When investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it's an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back. So how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?Some argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices. "The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point," Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.The Fed's job just got even harderThe Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve. That could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation."Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession," Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.  Inflation concerns existed before Russia-UkraineAlthough geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine."Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy," said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week. Essaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren't in the headlines."The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth," he said.Rising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble.

Rates fall when investors are buying bonds. So traders are clearly still finding US Treasury debt to be stable enough to keep flocking to it. But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.One strategist noted that it doesn't matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about. "The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume," Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. "Of course there are many reasons to be concerned. Soaring inflation, rising energy costs, an almost sure recession in the Euro Zone and a dangerously flat yield curve." "Never mind that the yield curve is being distorted by a massive flight to quality," Tengler added. "An inversion is an inversion."
23,,New York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden planned to reshape the Federal Reserve through his nominations for the three vacant seats on the board of governors. But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia threw a wrench into those plans Monday.The crux of the matter is the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board during the Obama administration, who is facing opposition in a divided Senate.Raskin's stance on environmental issues, including her view on the transition away from fossil fuels, are colliding with soaring gas prices and a renewed debate about oil independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs," Manchin said in a statement on Monday announcing his opposition to Raskin's nomination. Manchin is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that will be voting on Raskin's candidacy.The US Chamber of Commerce already voiced concern over her nomination to be the vice chair of supervision -- essentially the Fed's top banking regulator -- in January. And a month ago, Senate Republicans boycotted a vote in protest of Raskin's nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank.Read MoreThe renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for another term is also stalled. Even though Powell is enjoying support on both sides of the aisle, he hasn't been fully confirmed yet, leaving him with the title add-on "pro tempore" for now.All this comes at a time when Fed policy has taken center stage amid rampant inflation. Consumer prices haven't risen at this fast a pace since 1982.The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week in an effort to curb demand and bring prices under control.Meanwhile, the White House continued to stand behind Raskin's nomination. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial make up. The president also nominated Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook to join the central bank. Cook would be the first Black woman to serve at the Fed in its history."Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- she previously served on the Board and she served as second-in-command at Treasury, both positions where she earned bipartisan Senate confirmation," a White House official said.The administration was working to line up bipartisan support for her confirmation, the official added, calling the adversity surrounding her nomination an "unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil and gas companies."CNN's Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.

They say that the board has failed to adopt and implement a climate strategy that aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement, claiming that amounts to an alleged breach of the directors' duties under the UK Companies Act.ClientEarth said it had written to Shell notifying it of its claim and was waiting for it to respond before filing papers at the High Court of England and Wales. For the case to proceed, ClientEarth would then need permission from the court to do so."We believe that there are sufficient grounds to assert that Shell's board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company," said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson in a statement. "Unless the board changes course, long-term value will be eroded, and eventually destroyed," he added.In a written response to Reuters, Shell said it was delivering on its global strategy that supported the Paris Agreement on climate, including by "transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers."Read More"Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonizing our energy system. These challenges cannot be solved by litigation," Shell said.Court orders Shell to slash CO2 emissions in landmark climate rulingThe legal action comes less than a year after a Dutch court made a landmark ruling that Shell must dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing that ruling.ClientEarth, a not-for-profit, has a track record of winning climate litigation cases. Last year it won a case against the European Investment Bank, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled it had illegally avoided environmental scrutiny of its financing decisions. In 2020, the company Enea suspended construction of a coal plant in Poland after the group took it to court. The court ruled that authorizing the project was legally invalid. Energy companies are facing a challenge to their business model as countries look to cut use of fossil fuels, a major cause of human-made global warming, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.Shell has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2030, but its plans to reduce emissions from the actual use of its products was not far-reaching enough, ClientEarth said. Shell's net-zero target was also not reflected in the company's operating plans or budgets, ClientEarth added.UN climate scientists have reiterated the need for faster global action and said failure to hit the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms would cause irreparable damage. The UK Companies Act would require Shell to act in a way that promotes the company's success, and to do so whilst exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence.ClientEarth said it was bringing the action as a shareholder in Shell on behalf of all stakeholders to help protect the long-term viability of the company.
25,,London (CNN Business)In the Swiss municipality of Arbedo-Castione, a 70-meter crane stands tall. Six arms protrude from the top, hoisting giant blocks into the sky. But these aren't building blocks, and the crane isn't being used for construction. The steel tower is a giant mechanical energy storage system, designed by American-Swiss startup Energy Vault, that relies on gravity and 35-ton bricks to store and release energy. When power demand is low, the crane uses surplus electricity from the Swiss grid to raise the bricks and stack them at the top. When power demand rises, the bricks are lowered, releasing kinetic energy back to the grid. It might sound like a school science project, but this form of energy storage could be vital as the world transitions to clean energy.35-ton blocks, made of recycled or locally sourced materials, are raised to the top of the crane where they store energy."There's a big push to get renewables deployed," Robert Piconi, founder of Energy Vault, tells CNN Business, adding that companies are under increasing pressure from governments, investors and employees to decarbonize.Read MoreBut relying on renewables for consistent power is impossible without energy storage, he says. Unlike a fossil fuel power station, which can operate night and day, wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that if a cloud blocks the sun or there's a lull in the wind, electricity generation drops.To compete with fossil fuels, you need to "make renewables predictable," says Piconi, which means storing excess energy and being able to dispatch it when required. Battery alternativesOne solution to this problem is lithium-ion batteries, which are already linked up to power grids worldwide. They can be charged using electricity generated from wind and solar and release that energy on demand. The technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades, says Dan Shreve, global head of energy storage at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consultancy firm. For the most part, they have been used for short-term energy storage (up to six hours), he says, and as decarbonization ramps up, demand for more durable storage will rise.Another drawback is that lithium is a limited resource, found only in certain parts of the world, and mining it can harm the environment. While the cost of batteries has plummeted over the last decade, prices started to soar in 2021 as lithium demand outstripped supply. For these reasons, Piconi says that while batteries are great for electric cars or computer electronics, they're not "ideal for large utility-scale trade." Instead, Energy Vault decided to base its technology on a method developed over 100 years ago, which is widely used to store renewable energy: pumped storage hydropower. During off-peak periods, a turbine pumps water from a reservoir on low ground to one on higher ground, and during periods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down through the turbine, generating electrical energy. Piconi says Energy Vault relies on gravity in the same way, but "instead of using water, we're using these composite blocks." By doing it this way, he says the company is not dependent on topography and doesn't have to dig out reservoirs or create dams, which can have negative effects on the environment. "Simple and elegant"Since Energy Vault established its successful prototype in Switzerland in 2020, the company has pivoted from the tower model design, which could reach up to 200 meters in height, to 20-story modular buildings it calls "Energy Vault Resiliency Centers." Piconi says the company received feedback from potential clients that the tower was "too tall" and might not comply with international building codes.Energy Vault pivoted its design from giant cranes to vast energy storage buildings, as shown in this rendering.The resiliency centers will use the same bricks, made from soil and waste products, and the buildings will be around 100 meters tall. Bricks will move up and down inside the building on trolleys, controlled by an artificial intelligence system that identifies optimal times for charging or discharging energy, depending on supply and demand.The centers will vary in footprint, possibly covering between 1.5 and 20 acres depending on the storage capacity, he adds. But they are likely to be installed in places where space isn't an issue, such as near existing wind or solar plants. Energy Vault's technology is "simple and elegant," says Shreve, but he questions whether the devices can compete with lithium-ion batteries on price. Even so, the market is hungry for battery alternatives. While other startups — such as UK-based Gravitricity, which drops weights down disused mineshafts — are also exploring gravity-based energy storage, none yet match the scale of Energy Vault.In February, Energy Vault listed on the New York stock exchange, raising approximately $235 million. It recently announced that actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had joined the company's strategic advisory board. Energy Vault's resiliency centers will be linked up to nearby wind or solar farms, as shown in this rendering. Credit: Energy Vault This year, Energy Vault will start building resiliency centers for DG fuels, which wants a continuous supply of renewable energy to create green hydrogen fuel for the aviation industry. It has also signed deals worth up to $880 million with companies including Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, metal smelting company Korea Zinc, and mining giant BHP. With this backing, Piconi is confident Energy Vault can help to accelerate the energy transition.So far, customers have signed up to projects that equate to 2.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage — a significant addition to the 17 gigawatt hours of battery storage that Wood Mackenzie estimates is currently in operation in the United States. "In terms of impact, that's pretty massive," says Piconi.
26,,New York (CNN Business)The auto industry has a saying: You can't build a car with 99% of the parts. But the computer chip shortage is proving that adage wrong.Ford (F) will begin shipping Explorer SUVs without all of its chips to address the tight inventory of vehicles available for sale at dealerships.The automaker disclosed this weekend that it would build Explorers without rear-seat controls for the air conditioner and heat. The driver and front-seat passenger will still be able to adjust climate controls for backseat passengers — but people in the back won't be able to change the temperature themselves."We're doing this as a way to get our customers their vehicles sooner," said Ford spokesperson Said Deep. He said Ford had already offered buyers of its best-selling F-150 pickup a choice: They could give up a fuel-saving feature called "start-stop" and get a $50 credit — or they could wait for the truck to be built with the feature. Start-stop automatically turns the engine off when the truck comes to a complete stop, and restarts it when the driver takes his or her foot off the brake.Read MoreThe start-stop option is only available at the time an F-150 is built, and cannot be added after the fact. But Deep said Ford will be able to install the rear-seat climate control feature on Explorers shipped without the feature once the chips become available. It will be added at dealerships at no cost to the owners.Virtually all automakers have been forced to temporarily shut production at some of their factories over the last year and a half due to the lack of computer chips and, in some cases, other parts. The reduced inventories of new vehicles for sale have lifted car prices to record levels — a major factor in America's highest rate of inflation in nearly 40 years.Why car prices remain so stubbornly highFord is not the only automaker shipping vehicles without all the features they were designed to include. Last year General Motors was forced to temporarily stop offering several features, including a fuel management module designed to improve mileage in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups by about one mile per gallon. GM also stopped offering a stop-start feature on some of its heavy-duty pickups.GM also had to exclude some comfort features, such as heated and cooled seats in a variety of models, the adjustable lumbar support in the Cadillac XT4, as well as parking assist features. But GM (GM) also expects it will be able to offer a free retrofit for those features once the chips become available.
27,,Washington, DC (CNN)Ben Morris bought his Tesla in 2020 believing that it would drive itself one day. Now he says he would settle for continuing to feel safe using its cruise control. Morris is one of hundreds of Tesla owners claiming that the automaker's cruise control has deteriorated and turned dangerous in the last year on some models. They've filed complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which opened an investigation last month.  In the complaints, the owners say they've nearly been rear-ended after their vehicles brake unexpectedly, which they call "phantom braking." Many say they have stopped using cruise control because they're afraid it will trigger a crash. Some drivers have said on social media and in interviews with CNN Business that the cruise control issues have them questioning when or if Tesla will deliver self-driving vehicles, which tech and auto companies have promised for years.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 that self-driving Teslas were probably either a year or two away. More recently, he's said that self-driving will be a reality this year, even as the automaker continues to describe its more basic driver-assist feature "traffic-aware cruise control," as a beta feature almost seven years after its launch. (Beta is Silicon Valley lingo for an unfinished and imperfect product.) "They're burning up a lot of good will with not being transparent," Morris told CNN Business. "People are starting to realize, 'My car may actually never drive itself.'" Read MoreTesla did not respond to a request for comment."The ultimate gadget" Morris, a software engineer in Indiana, describes Teslas as "the ultimate gadget." He grew excited in recent years after hearing Musk's talk of Teslas driving themselves. "I wanted to make sure I got a Tesla with all the bells and whistles, and 'full self-driving' was one of them," Morris said, referring to a Tesla driver-assist feature that is expected to eventually be able to drive the vehicle. For now, "full self-driving" requires an attentive driver behind the wheel, and has only been released to a limited number of Tesla drivers, who have described significant issues. Morris said he was happy with his first Tesla, a 2016 Model S. When its warranty ended, he purchased the Model X he still owns today. Then almost a year ago, Morris surprised his wife on Mother's Day with a Tesla Model Y. Morris said shortly before the SUV arrived, Tesla messaged him to say that the radar was being phased out of the automaker's cruise control. Most automakers rely on radar for adaptive cruise control, which speeds up and slows down the vehicle slightly to keep pace with a vehicle in front of it. (Tesla calls its adaptive cruise control, "traffic-aware cruise control.") Most autonomous vehicle experts favor sensor fusion, in which camera and radar data are combined to sense a car's surroundings.  "It's like pairing one A student with another A student," said Steven Hong, vice president of radar technology at Ambarella, which is combining radar and camera in a driver-assist system. "Put them together and you'll get an A+ on your perception project as they cover each other's weaknesses." Cameras can struggle in poor lighting conditions whereas radar functions even if there is rain, fog, or mud covering the vehicle, he said. Trouble for Morris began not long after the Model Y arrived, he said. The car often braked unexpectedly as his wife commuted on a two-lane road in rural Indiana. According to a review by CNN Business, more than 120 drivers have filed complaints with NHTSA describing unexpected braking on two-lane roads. "Cruise control is completely unusable on two-lane roads," wrote one person in February who said they were from Des Moines, Iowa. As his wife drove on the two-lane road last fall, her Model Y slammed on its brakes so hard that his children's empty booster seats in the second row flew forward and crashed into the front seats, he said.  A concerned Morris reached out to Tesla. The automaker told Morris, according to screenshots shared with CNN Business, that there was no hardware failure. "Because there is no need for service we will close out this appointment," the automaker wrote. It also explained that cruise control is a beta feature. "As far as I understand cruise control should not be a beta feature," he replied. Then he checked his owner's manual, which calls traffic-aware cruise control a beta feature. Tesla introduced the feature in 2015 and based on a review of Tesla owner's manuals, it appears that the automaker started labeling it a "beta" feature in 2018. Morris filed a complaint with the US government in November, noting that "we don't accept beta seatbelts or beta tires." Thirty other Tesla owners filing complaints of unexpected braking say that Tesla has either canceled service appointments or told them there is nothing they can do, according to a CNN Business review of complaints. Cruising along Tesla introduced "traffic-aware cruise control" to its vehicles in 2015. Previously, Teslas included a basic cruise control that held a consistent speed without requiring that drivers keep their foot on the accelerator, according to a review of Tesla owners' manuals. Traffic-aware cruise control initially relied on a radar and camera to sense the road ahead, and Tesla warned of the feature's limitations. "Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may occasionally brake Model S when not required," cautioned the 2015 Model S owner's manual. A similar warning remains in the latest Tesla owners' manuals. Other automakers also warned that adaptive cruise control has shortcomings. Ford, for example, cautions that its system may brake unexpectedly. It recommends against using adaptive cruise control on winding roads, as do General Motors, Toyota, Honda and Tesla, according to a review of owner's manuals.Morris, the Tesla owner, also drives a Ford F-150 with adaptive cruise control. He said he's never experienced unexpected braking with it. He said his Model X, which has a radar, does not brake unexpectedly on the same roads that his wife's radar-less Tesla struggled with. But the use of radar does not prevent all unexpected braking issues. NHTSA opened an investigation last month into unexpected braking of 2017-2019 Honda CR-Vs and 2018-19 Honda Accords following 278 complaints. Honda's system relies on radar. Tesla owners have long described on social media episodes of phantom braking on radar-equipped vehicles, generally slowing the car about 5 mph, not as severe as what's been reported to NHTSA.  Morris has since traded in the Model Y for Ford's Mustang Mach-E. The infotainment system is "kind of clunky" and can't match Tesla's, he said, but his unexpected braking worries are gone. The F-150 and Mustang's system relies on a radar and camera. Morris said he would have kept the Model Y if it had offered a dumbed-down cruise control that held a constant speed. He still loves his Model X, for now. "If they ever disable my radar," Morris said. "I'm going to probably get rid of it, too."
28,,New York (CNN Business)NASA said Monday that NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei will return from the ISS later this month aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft as previously planned. The space agency sought to reaffirm Monday that it's still working closely with Russian space agency Rocosmos on the International Space Station, despite mounting geopolitical tensions.Vande Hei, who launched to the ISS in April 2021, is slated to make his return trip on March 30. He'll land aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in Kazakhstan, as is customary. NASA officials did not say there would be any significant changes to plans to get Vande Hei back to the United States after he lands. He'll travel home via a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.For nearly a decade, Russia's Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilitiesThe US still has previously purchased seats on Russian vehicles for NASA astronauts, however, and there are tentative agreements for US astronauts to ride on Russian Soyuz vehicles and for Russian cosmonauts to fly with SpaceX in the future.Joint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan "continue to go well," Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, said, "I can tell you for sure Mark [Vande Hei] is coming home" on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.Read MoreMontalbano's remarks come as Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin made several fiery social media posts directed at the United States, including a heavily edited, partially animated video that appeared to threaten that Russian astronauts would abandon Vande Hei in space. Rogozin has long been known to share outlandish statements on social media.Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian space chief engage in Twitter fight Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions from the United States and its allies, Rogozin has also grounded the launch of telecom satellites from UK-based startup OneWeb. He's also pledged to no longer sell Russian-made rocket engines to US companies.Despite mounting tensions, NASA has attempted to convey that, behind the scenes, the US and Russia continue to work together on ISS operations. Earlier Monday, Russian state new outlet Tass announced Vande Hei would return on the Russian spacecraft as planned.And that work is crucial to keep the station going. Montalbano said the "space station was designed to be interdependent.""Each of the partners have different capabilities that they bring, and together we work," he said. "It's not a process where one group can separate from the other. We need everything together in order to be successful."When CNN's Kristin Fisher asked whether NASA has contingency plans in place in case the Roscosmos-NASA relationship does deteriorate, Montalbano said, "the International Space Station, I'll tell you, it's been the flagship model for international cooperation.""At this time there's no indication from our Russian partners that they want to do anything different," he said. "So, we are planning to continue operations as, as we are today."Russian space chief says Russia will no longer sell rocket engines to the USNASA's Montalbano said Monday that they are continuing to work on those negotiations and plan to move forward with a crew swap agreement.
29,,New York (CNN Business)Pete Davidson will become the latest celebrity to fly to space with Jeff Bezos' rocket company, Blue Origin, in a brief, suborbital flight slated for later this month.The company announced Monday morning that Davidson, the Saturday Night Live Star who's become a pillar of entertainment intrigue amid his relationship with Kim Kardashian, will fly alongside five paying customers on Blue Origin's 60-foot-tall New Shepard rocket.The launch is slated for March 23 at 8:30 am CT, according to Blue Origin. The announcement comes after CNN confirmed earlier that Davidson was in talks with the company for a seat aboard its supersonic rocket, which launches vertically from a rural Texas launch pad on Bezos' ranch.After years of quiet development, Blue Origin's space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer. Since then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan. Read MoreBlue Origin's goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joy ride to welcomed guests — which thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.Davidson will be joined on his flight by five paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.A billionaire CEO is on track to go further into space than any human in 50 yearsThe crew will spend a few days training at Blue Origin's facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they'll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule's windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth.As the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window.As gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense g-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert.Blue Origin's New Shepard lifts off from the launch pad carrying 90-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner and three other civilians on October 13, 2021 near Van Horn, Texas. Because the flights are suborbital — meaning the don't generate enough speed or take the right trajectory to avoid being immediately dragged back down by Earth's gravity — the whole show will last only about 10 minutes.Blue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos' flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company's space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says its undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.SpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And later this month, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.Blue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines.Blue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.CNN's Rachel Crane contributed
30,,New Delhi (CNN Business)Indian businesswoman Swati Daga first bought bitcoin in 2017, when the cryptocurrency was trading well under $3,000. Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls. "The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away," said Daga, who runs a food business near New Delhi.But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision — bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then — and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. "I find stock markets boring," she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the "thrill" and "recklessness" that comes with investing in volatile currencies.  She is not the only one.  Read MoreIndia has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even flirted with banning them. Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with 750 million users, and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors. The growth is driven by younger investors — mostly under the age of 35 — and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started "their investing journey with crypto."While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters "are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio," Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the World Gold Council. It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies.Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. The CoinDCX app is seen on a phone screen in West Bengal, India, in August 2021.Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a "phenomenal year" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019.Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a "700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas." Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68,990, but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base.Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen "a massive upside" in the past 18 months and is "fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets." The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women — which is the global trend as well.On-again, off-again relationshipThe excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to "prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India."This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. "Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry," Gupta said at the time of the announcement.Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. WazirX's website is shown in New York, USA, in April 2021."I'm getting LinkedIn messages" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country."I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. "Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right." "I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective," said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India."It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency."Rastogi added that the "extraordinarily high" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. "This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery," he said. "So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive."For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year.Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a "superpower in the next five to 10 years," in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. "What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework," he added.
31,,New Delhi (CNN Business)India is planning to launch a digital version of the rupee, becoming the latest country to join the rush to create state-backed virtual currencies. The country's central bank expects to introduce the currency "using blockchain and other technologies" some time in the new fiscal year, which begins in April, according to Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Presenting India's annual budget to parliament on Tuesday, Sitharaman said the digital rupee would "give a big boost to the digital economy." She did not give any further details about what the launch would entail, how widely a digital rupee might be used initially, or what impact it might have. India sows confusion with plan to ban 'private cryptocurrencies'Digital payments have grown dramatically in popularity in India since late 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the country's two biggest rupee bank notes. Apart from homegrown players such as Paytm, some of the world's biggest tech companies, including Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), have joined India's cashless payments boom.The announcement comes as other major economies move forward with their own plans to launch virtual versions of their own currencies. China has been trialing its digital yuan in major cities for the last two years. It's one of only three payment methods available to athletes, officials and journalists attending the Beijing Winter Olympics this month. Read MoreEurope and the United States have also been exploring the possibilities for a digital euro and digital dollar, though both have stressed the importance of mitigating financial risk presented by any e-currency.India has for years expressed concern about cryptocurrencies and how best to regulate digital assets, at times even flirting with a ban on cryptos. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year suggested the government was exploring plans to "prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India." The central bank has often expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism.No ban on cryptocurrenciesIn her speech Tuesday, Sitharaman suggested that authorities are willing to continue allowing crypto trading in the country, albeit with some regulations. She said that the Indian government would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets."There has been a phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual digital assets," Sitharaman said. "The magnitude and frequency of these transactions have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime."The budget speech was greeted with a sigh of relief from India's crypto investors, and industry experts pointed to Sitharaman's remarks as a sign that Asia's third largest economy would not ban virtual currencies."Hope to see a reduction of crypto ban fear in India." tweeted Nischal Shetty, the founder of cryptocurrency platform WazirX, on Tuesday. "Lot to unpack here but overall this is a very positive step forward for crypto ecosystem in India."Virtual currencies have become attractive to Indians since the start of the pandemic. While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, media reports have suggested that the country may hold as many as 20 million crypto investors, citing industry experts."Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry," said Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, an exchange that is also India's first crypto unicorn.
32,,As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.Adar Poonawalla — the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker — pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN), was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. "It was a calculated risk," Poonawalla told CNN Business. "But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another."Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. Read MoreAs the world gave its money — and trust — to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. "It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another."SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccineBut soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations — the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. From horse breeders to vaccine makersIt's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company — which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago — produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would "just be making batches and then end up throwing them away," Poonawalla said.Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. "The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this," said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. India's Covid-19 tsunamiBut Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021."I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say," Poonawalla said. "There was no two ways about that."The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be "catastrophic" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, "very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment," the spokesperson said, adding that it was "natural" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. "Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight," said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Being held to accountWhile Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling — chief among them, India's massive outbreak — his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push."There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went," Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it "very unreasonable and naive" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.He also insists he was realistic about his goals. "We always underpromise," Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a "philanthropic gesture" — leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII."AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII," Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a "very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October — about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.
33,,New Delhi (CNN Business)More than two decades ago, India began its transformation into a global IT powerhouse, ushering in an era of wealth and job creation never before seen in the country. Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, according to a KPMG survey. TCS employs more than 500,000 people. It's ready to ditch office life for many in IndiaSaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include Zoom (ZM), SAP Concur and Salesforce (CRM), the American behemoth that owns workplace messaging app Slack.India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a recent report compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders.Read MoreThere are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. "This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s," said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an IPO last month, joining a string of other major Indian tech unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. Zenoti, for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Bullish investorsInvestors are excited about SaaS because of the "massive adoption" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India.Girish Mathrubootham, CEO and founder of Freshworks, a "SaaS" or "Software-as-a-service" company founded in Chennai, India.While India is a small player in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them.Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most sought-after career options in the country. "India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world," Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies.Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. "We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem," Asthana told CNN Business.Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion.International clients, Indian engineersThe low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by consulting firm Bain & Company, the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States.Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman in India."If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country," said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. "When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones."Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and Infosys (INFY). Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns — from Flipkart to Paytm — have focused primarily on the domestic market.Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times.India is churning out billion-dollar startups. Now they need to start making money"For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global," said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere — they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory.Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs "mastered" the art of "remote sales" fairly early. "Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales," he added.Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company.In IT services, "you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says," said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a "global tech powerhouse product brand." But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. "It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation," he added.
34,,New Delhi (CNN Business)India's stock market celebrated an extraordinary year as some of the country's buzziest tech firms made their public debuts. And while one high-profile blunder cast a chill over the festivities, that's probably not enough to stop the excitement in 2022. By December, more than $15 billion had been raised in Mumbai through initial public offerings, a record amount, according to Dealogic. About $6 billion, or nearly 40%, went to tech companies — another record.This year was historic for another big reason: It's the first time any of India's tech unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, have gone public. Those milestones indicate how much of a shift happened this year for tech darlings tapping investment in Asia's third largest economy. India's unicorns have in the past focused on exclusively raising funds from private markets, fearing that the country's conservative investors would not understand their business models.Most of these high-profile startups are losing money, which was making retail investors leery, Piyush Nagda, head of investment products at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, told CNN Business. Read MoreBut that all changed after food delivery giant Zomato made its red hot debut this summer. Nagda said the IPO sent a clear signal that "perception is changing" among investors.The party that started with Zomato's $1.3 billion IPO — the company popped 65% on listing day to reach a market value of $13 billion — swept up a handful of other tech firms as well. E-commerce company Nykaa and online insurance marketplace Policybazaar each surged on their debuts.The euphoria came to a screeching halt with Paytm's disastrous IPO last month. The mammoth listing from the digital payments firm crashed 27% on its first day of trading, and hasn't come close to reaching its offer price again.Despite that fiasco, which analysts blamed on the lack of a clear pathway to profitability and an overly high valuation, other Indian tech firms likely won't be stopped from going public in the coming years. They'll just have to be careful about how they price themselves and whether they're buying too much into the hype.Why the party could keep going There are a few reasons to remain hopeful about the Indian tech sector.Many of the country's digital startups saw a big jump in growth during the pandemic, both in terms of customers and funding. Coronavirus-related lockdowns have encouraged people outside of major cities to spend money online, speeding up digitization of businesses and opening up more opportunities for technology entrepreneurs.Tech firms in India have raised nearly $25 billion this year, the highest annual amount ever, according to data platform Tracxn. Some 34 companies have reached unicorn status.India has also attracted more attention from top global investors this year due to the crackdown on tech firms in China, where authorities have imposed sweeping curbs on private enterprise that have eaten into share prices and triggered concerns about future growth.As a result of those regulatory actions, "growth investors have shifted funds to India" said Tom Masi and Nuno Fernandes, co-portfolio managers of the emerging wealth strategy at GW&K Investment Management. They told CNN Business that the performances of the two countries have diverged this year, "with India up about 20% and China down 20%."China may have to juice its economy soon as 'stagflation' risk risesNagda also said that interest in Indian tech from global investors has made the sector more attractive to India's tech-savvy millennials. He estimates that India added about 20 million retail investors since April 2020, and between 30% to 40% of them are under the age of 40. They've been piling into the stock market since the pandemic started, and are eager to invest in the country's internet giants, he added. And, they should be getting plenty of opportunities next year, with some of India's biggest startups gearing up for IPOs, including Walmart-owned Flipkart and hotel chain OYO. Young investors don't look at companies in a "traditional" manner "where profitability and those kind of ratios were heavily looked at," Nagda said, adding that there is a "revolutionary change" underway in stock trading in India. A wake-up callEven those investors may have their limit, though.Paytm raised $2.5 billion during its IPO, with almost half of that coming from foreign investors.The company was valued at $20 billion when it launched its public offering — even though it lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seemed far from ready to turn a profit."Paytm was overpriced," said Masi and Fernandes. "It required investors to make growth assumptions well into the future for a business model that has not been firmly established."Some analysts describe Paytm's flop as a much-needed wake-up call for companies that need to rethink their valuations."Some rationality will prevail," Nagda said. To see Zomato-like "success stories," you need to "price the stock rightly," he added.After Paytm's historically terrible debut, some companies in fintech sector are rethinking their IPOs. Paytm's smaller rival Mobikwik said it would defer its IPO, originally planned for November, by a few months. Paytm is still struggling to convince investors after disastrous IPO"The company is witnessing strong business growth, has a clear path to profitability and will list at the right time," it told CNN Business.Some tech entrepreneurs have urged caution while chasing big money in public markets. Nithin Kamath, founder of India's largest retail brokerage Zerodha, tweeted recently that his firm won't be filing for an IPO, even though he "can potentially get ridiculous valuations.""We are in a world where companies are getting priced to perfection based on all the future growth potential. For a stock to do well, you have to outperform," he wrote. "As CEO, I dread to think how you can outperform the already really high expectations that growth companies have today."Along with managing overwhelming expectations, startups that go public will also have to adjust to the amount of company information they'd be expected to regularly reveal to their new shareholders. Privately held tech giants are less beholden to such transparency. And many investors think those requirements would be a welcome change.There will be "visibility into this for the very, very first time," said Karthik Reddy, co-founder of venture capital firm Blume Ventures. "Even I don't know what was going on in all these companies, even though I'm an industry person."
35,,New York (CNNBusiness)Far-reaching global sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine are affecting the global supply of a precious commodity --  the diamonds used in jewelry. President Biden on Friday issued an executive order prohibiting imports of certain products originating in Russia. They include fish, seafood, luxury goods, alcoholic beverages and nonindustrial diamonds.The ban directly targets Alrosa, which the US government identified as the world's largest diamond mining company, responsible for 90 percent of Russia's diamond mining capacity and accounting for 28%, or nearly a third, of global diamond output. In 2021, Alrosa supplied 32.4 million carats of diamonds. Alrosa is partly owned by the Russian government and its shares trade on the Moscow Stock Exchange.Alrosa accouts for as much as a third of the global output of rough diamonds."This is a very big deal and a once-in-a-lifetime situation for the diamond industry," said Tiffany Stevens, CEO and general counsel of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee (JVC), a 105-year-old non-profit that advocates for the US jewelry industry and provides legal education and compliance guidance to its 600 individual members.Read MoreOn Friday, JVC advised its members that any US business purchasing diamonds directly from a Russian company should immediately halt the transactions. The warning specifically mentioned Alrosa and Alrosa USA.At the same time, JVC said it isn't clear how US Customs will treat imports of polished diamonds that come from other countries but originated in Russia. A raw diamond can touch many countries as it goes from an uncut gem to a beguiling necklace or ring. "The issue is 'what is considered of Russian origin?'" Stevens said. "It can originate in Russia and is then cut and polished in India. Is it then considered an Indian diamond at that point?" The diamond industry would benefit from further guidance from the US government on how the new policy would be applied, she added. Adding pressureThe ban on Russian diamonds is an escalation of the sanctions first applied by the US in late February and could lead to acute diamond supply chain disruptions, said Paul Zimnisky, an independent diamond industry analyst.As part of that initial set of sanctions, the US Treasury listed major state-owned and private entities that it believes are critical to the Russian economy. Included on the list is Alrosa and, separately, its CEO, Sergei S. Ivanov. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said Ivanov is the son of Sergei B. Ivanov, reportedly one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies.The surprising reason perfume prices are skyrocketingThe Treasury Department said sanctions against Alrosa will heavily restrict the company's ability to raise money through the US market -- a key source of capital and revenue generation -- limiting the Russian government's ability to fund the further invasion of Ukraine.Although the first wave of sanctions didn't outright ban companies from buying diamonds from Russia, they complicated businesses' ability to pay for them since many of Russia's banks have been expelled from the international banking system SWIFT, said Zimnisky."(The sanctions) would draw out the delivery of rough diamonds by weeks, potentially months, to manufacturers who cut and polish the diamonds," he said. For example, India -- which accounts for 90% of all diamond cutting and polishing in the world -- would immediately feel the impact. The delays of up to three to six months will then make their way to retailers who buy the polished diamonds, he said.A view of Botuobinsky diamond mining pit of Nakyn diamond ore field, some 340 kms northeast  from the town of Mirny.The ban now means US businesses can't buy Russian diamonds at all and will have to source Canadian, African, Brazilian or Australian diamonds, said Zimnisky.Another hurdle he anticipates layered on top of the hard-hitting government sanctions are "self sanctions," stemming from the moral and ethical stance that consumers themselves may adopt. "For many retailers, up to a third of their existing diamond inventory is of Russian origin," he said.Fine jewelry seller Brilliant Earth tweeted last month that it had removed all Russian mined diamonds from its website and that it hoped for a "peaceful and swift resolution in Ukraine." Signet Jewelers, one of the largest sellers of diamond jewelry in the world, said it suspended business interaction with Russian-owned entities at the beginning of the invasion, "in unity with all those in the world calling for peace."Signet (SIG) operates jewelry chains Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers and Diamonds Direct under its corporate umbrella.Alrosa last week suspended its own membership in the Natural Diamond Council, a diamond industry group that promotes and markets the use of natural diamonds. Its members include leading diamond producers De Beers and Dominion Diamond Mines. Diamond supply already tightThe threat of disruptions to the diamond supply chain comes as the industry is already experiencing record global demand for diamonds and supply is at a decade-low level."Demand has been so robust over the past two years that there is essentially no excess inventory of diamonds right now," said Zimnisky.Jewelry purchases, and diamond jewelry, in particular, saw a boost through the pandemic, spurred by stimulus check spending and a build up of savings as Covid restrictions prevented other types of discretionary activities, such as travel and dining out.Retail sales of diamond jewelry jumped 29% last year versus 2020 and were up 11% over 2019, according to a new report from consulting firm Bain & Company. Bain expects demand for diamond jewelry and polished and rough diamonds to continue to grow through the first half of this year. "In 2022 the market is expected to demonstrate growth higher than the pre-pandemic period and return to historic growth pace by 2023-24," the report said.Man-made diamonds are the new engagement ring trendZimnisky anticipates that the weight of geopolitical tension will affect diamond prices. "The time to watch is midyear, when businesses start to stock up on diamonds in preparation of holiday demand. I think that's when the shortages will be felt most," he said.Martin Rapaport, founder of diamond industry research publication Rapaport Diamond Report and chair of the Rapaport Group which provides services to the diamond industry, sees the situation somewhat differently."Shortages of wheat, oil and other essentials and their impact on inflation will have a greater effect on diamond prices than any shortages of diamonds," he said.
36,,(CNN Business)Ukraine's two leading suppliers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted their operations as Moscow has sharpened its attack on the country, threatening to raise prices and aggravate the semiconductor shortage.Some 45%-54% of the world's semiconductor grade neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, comes from two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the companies and market research firm Techcet. Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates.Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cell phones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.Read More"If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don't have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers," he said.Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters.The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters."Civilians are suffering," Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access.Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the attacks began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly.She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for making neon.Taiwan's Economy Ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had "safety stocks" of neon, so it did not see any problems in the supply chain in the near term.Russia-Ukraine crisis replaces Covid as top risk to global supply chains, Moody's saysTaiwan's central bank made similar comments earlier on Friday.Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily.Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan/cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan/cubic meter in late February.Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors.But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary.
37,,London (CNN Business)Nickel prices have soared to all-time highs in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, threatening the global transition to electric vehicles. The London Metal Exchange suspended trading in nickel on Tuesday for the first time in its 145-year history after prices doubled in a matter of hours to $100,000 per metric ton.Prices eased back to about $80,000 per metric ton. But that's still far above the previous record of $52,000 per metric ton set in 2007. The metal is a key component in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, and is one of several commodities that have spiked in price since Russia attacked its neighbor. Markets fear Western sanctions will limit exports from the region, resulting in supply shocks. Russia is the world's third biggest supplier of nickel behind Indonesia and the Philippines, making up about 13% of global mining capacity in 2021, according to Rystad Energy. Read More''The breathtaking rise of commodities is causing a whirlwind of anxiety on financial markets and exchanges, as traders speculate about the knock on effects of the Ukraine conflict," Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a research note on Tuesday. The rapid rise in nickel prices may have been caused by a short squeeze, said Streeter.Rising nickel prices are another potential headache for automakers who have spent the past year grappling with supply chain disruptions, plant shutdowns and a shortage of semiconductor chips.  James Ley, senior vice president of energy metals at Rystad Energy, told CNN Business that the nickel price surge was "unprecedented" and could theoretically push the cost of some EV batteries up by a third. But automakers are unlikely to feel the impact immediately as many will have locked in nickel prices through long-term contracts, he said. "I think we need to see where nickel will eventually settle in price before fully understanding the long-term implications," Ley said. Global EV sales boomed last year, but higher battery or vehicle prices would cast doubt over whether the speed of the transition away from internal combustion engines can be maintained. Al Bedwell, director of global powertrain at LMC Automotive, said he expects nickel prices to stay elevated for some time. But surging oil and gasoline prices mean that people who were considering an electric car may not be easily dissuaded."Whatever fuel one chooses, the cost of personal mobility will increase," Bedwell said.
38,,New York (CNN Business)Russia's attack on Ukraine is causing wheat prices to spike, exacerbating already high food prices. Wheat futures were up about 5.35% Tuesday, reaching prices not seen since 2008. The higher prices make wheat more expensive for food makers, who will likely pass those costs on to consumers. Ukraine and Russia together are responsible for about 14% of global wheat production, according to Gro Intelligence, an agricultural data analytics firm. The two countries supply about 29% of all wheat exports. Prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine was on track for a record year of wheat exports, while Russia's wheat exports were slowing, according to the US Department of Agriculture."This could not come have come in the worse time," said Robb MacKie, president and CEO of American Bakers Association. With wheat prices already on the rise, the conflict abroad is placing even more pressure on a still ailing supply chain. Russia is the top exporter or wheat, while Ukraine is in the top 5. The two counties compete in export markets like Egypt, Turkey, and Bangladesh.Read More"Depending on how this comes out and how long it goes, wheat farmers [in Ukraine] may not be able to plant spring wheat, corn and other things. So, they might go a year without any crops," MacKie added.That will likely push prices on US consumer items like cereal and bread higher. Cereal and baked goods were up 6.8% in the last year because of inflation, according to the US Labor Department. Consumer prices usually lag market prices of wheat, corn, grain -- as these commodity prices are contracted in advance. That means the impact may not be felt for weeks or months. Russia's actions also have caused a major disruption to Ukrainian ports, hobbling the export market. "You've got all kinds of logistical restrictions," said Jim Heneghan, SVP of Agribusiness at Gro Intelligence. For example, "Ukrainian ports [are] closed to commercial traffic," Heneghan said. And there also are reports of commercial ships being attacked. The disruptions are tightening global wheat supplies, even as demand stays the same or spikes. And with less supply, prices are rising even more than they have during the pandemic.  Global food prices rose as much as 28% in 2021, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Supply chain disruptions and extreme weather contributed to the higher prices. The current situation "is just adding to additional food price inflation that we've been witnessing," Heneghan said. US food prices are not immune Most US consumer brands don't rely on imported ingredients, said Katie Denis, who leads communications and research for the Consumer Brands Association, a US trade group. "For the US market, we only import about 8% of the total stuff needed for the [consumer packaged goods] industry," she said. "It's pretty minimal." Most imported items come from Mexico and Canada, she added. Higher wheat prices are good news for US farmers, as more demand could shift to the US. Even so, although US companies may not have direct exposure to disruptions in Ukraine, they aren't immune from them, either. "This is a global economy," Denis said. "The pricing pressure will be something felt across the entire world." Gro Intellligence's Heneghan said that as global supply tightens, US wheat farmers could export more product. "A lot of times, you'll see the demand come back to the US ... when you have global events that shut down exportable surpluses," he said. "But it comes at a higher price." That could be good news for US farmers, he added, but not for consumers.Wheat grows in a field near Uzhhorod, in the Zakarpattia region of Western Ukraine, in July 2020."Over the next few months, you'll see what food companies ... will have to do with the higher prices they're having to contend with," Heneghan said. Food and consumer goods producers may choose to absorb some of the price hikes, but they are more likely to continue to pass them onto consumers, he noted. The producer price index, which tracks average price changes America's producers get paid for their goods and services, rose 9.7% in the 12 months ended in January, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in February.And they're likely to raise prices further as input costs rise, Heneghan said, especially because wheat isn't the only crop that's getting more expensive.Other agricultural commodity prices are going up, such as corn and soybeans, not to mention oil. "It's going to give [consumer goods makers] even more reason to think about moving forward with those price increases," Heneghan said.

39,,London (CNN Business)Svein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.Record high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International, to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies. "It's not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It's how large that crisis will be," Holsether told CNN Business.Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.Wheat futures are soaring. Food prices could be nextAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it's never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.Read MoreThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.Agriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they "remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis."But fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need. Egypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world's most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It's the world's top producer of the product. The G7 ministers called on countries to "keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.""Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security," they said in a statement.Western countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.Russia, Ukraine and global food suppliesEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.The number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN's World Food Programme said this month.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.Global wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They're expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.The wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It's not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they'll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports."It's anyone's guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future," Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.Getting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don't want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.Russia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market."Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people," the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.Fertilizer costs soarThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock. "Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now," said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. "If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they're very scared."The price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color. But Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He's not sure when European production will be at full capacity again."There's a large part of the industry that's at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly," he said.Farmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.Countries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system."You can't grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer," said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.The consequencesOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.The war "has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers," Melnichenko told Reuters. "Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world's poorest countries," he added.The G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices."If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world's best wheat," David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. "Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost."Beasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen. "The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that's irreplaceable," Rabobank's Mera said.And it won't just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects. The affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute."We're used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food," she said. "People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they'll see it in the grocery stores."— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting.
40,,London (CNN Business)City dwellers are used to switching between apps to decide the best way to get from A to B. Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter?It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. "Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership," CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business.According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for 24% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, most of which come from passenger vehicles. If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. Car competitionRead MoreHe admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. "The car represents freedom of mobility," says Hietanen — even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a "freedom insurance."To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). The app was launched in Helsinki but is now available in several European and Asian cities.Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs €62 ($73) in Helsinki — where the app is most established — for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from €55 ($65) per day.While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city "does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London.She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. MaaS movementOther providers include Citymapper, which launched a travel pass for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an all-in-one mobility app in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as BP (BP), Mitsubishi (MBFJF) and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities.According to Whim, public transport and micromobility are the most popular ways to travel using the app. Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat recently reported that the company had spent €50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. "We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial," he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Greener travelThough the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A recent report from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, "people must choose it over other travel options" such as private motor vehicles.This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. "People want the more sustainable solution," he says, "but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime."
41,,(CNN Business)For centuries, humans have explored the Earth's mountains, jungles and deserts. But despite covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the sea floor; just over 20% of the ocean bed has been mapped.  Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the "blue economy," projected to be worth $3 trillion by 2030.Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called Seatrec is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing "the naturally occurring temperature difference" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. Greener and cheaperRead MoreThe power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite.Seatrec's float uses differences in ocean temperature to power itself.As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator."They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely," Chao said.This underwater concrete attracts marine life and gets stronger at the same timeA basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said.But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. Picking up the paceNew technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. "One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics," said McMichael-Phillips. "Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems." How 3D printing could help save Hong Kong's coralLaunched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as XOCEAN, are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform.Bedrock Ocean Exploration uses an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers.The challenge aheadEven with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. This vegan 'tech-style' startup wants to make clothes using algae Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised $2 million in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system.But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be "somewhere between $3 to $5 billion," according to McMichael-Phillips -- "pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars."Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet."If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live," he said, "we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean."
42,,(CNN)Two weeks after the United Kingdom dropped its last remaining Covid-19 mitigation measure -- a requirement that people who test positive for the virus isolate for five days -- the country is seeing cases and hospitalizations climb once again.  Covid-19 cases were up 48% in the UK last week compared with the week before. Hospitalizations were up 17% over the same period. The country's daily case rate -- about 55,000 a day -- is still less than a third of the Omicron peak, but cases are rising as fast as they were falling just two weeks earlier, when the country removed pandemic-related restrictions.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Is America ready to take the next step in its Covid-19 recovery?Daily cases are also rising in more than half of the countries in the European Union. They've jumped 48% in the Netherlands and 20% in Germany over the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. But daily cases in Germany had yet to drop below pre-Omicron levels, and the Netherlands hadn't seen cases fall as much as they did in the UK.  The situation in Europe has the attention of public health officials for two reasons: First, the UK offers a preview of what may play out in the United States, and second, something unusual seems to be happening. In previous waves, increases in Covid hospitalizations lagged behind jumps in cases by about 10 days to two weeks. Now, in the UK, cases and hospitalizations seem to be rising in tandem, something that has experts stumped.Read More"So we're obviously keenly interested in what's going on with that," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.  Fauci said he's spoken with his UK counterparts, and they have pegged the rise to a combination three factors. In order of contribution, Fauci said, these are:The BA.2 variant, which is more transmissible than the original Omicron The opening of society, with people mingling more indoors without masksWaning immunity from vaccination or prior infectionIn a technical briefing Friday, the UK Health Security Agency said BA.2 had an 80% higher relative growth rate than the original Omicron strain, though it does not seem more likely to lead to hospitalization.  White House warns of 'severe consequences' if Congress doesn't pass supplemental Covid fundingGiven that BA.2 doesn't seem to be causing more severe disease -- at least not in the highly vaccinated British population -- it's not clear why hospitalizations are ticking up."The issue with hospitalization is a little bit more puzzling, because although the hospitalizations are going up, it is very clear their use of ICU beds has not increased," Fauci said. "So are the numbers of hospitalizations a real reflection of Covid cases, or is there a difficulty deciphering between people coming into the hospital with Covid or because of Covid?" The US, like the UK, has lifted most mitigation measures as Covid-19 infections have fallen. Two weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed how it measures Covid-19 impact in communities. The new metric -- which relies on hospitalizations and hospital capacity in addition to cases -- did away with masking recommendations for most parts of the country. States and schools have followed suit, lifting indoor masking requirements.READ: Your top Covid questions, answered"Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we've really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here," Fauci said. "So that's the reason why we're watching this very carefully."Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN, "it's like a weather alert. Right now, the skies are sunny and bright, and we hope they stay that way. But we could have some bad weather by evening, and we just don't know."What will BA.2 do in the US?BA.2 has been growing steadily in the US. Last week, the CDC estimated it was causing about 12% of new Covid-19 cases here.  Meanwhile, BA.2 now accounts for more than 50% of cases in the UK and several other European countries."The tipping point seems to be right around 50%," said Keri Althoff, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "That's when we really start to see that variant flex its power in the population" as far as showing its severity.Covid-19 cases continue to rise in China's worst outbreak since WuhanAlthoff said although the UK may provide a glimpse of the future, there are key differences that will affect how BA.2 plays out in the United States.In the UK, 86% of eligible people are fully vaccinated, and 67% are boosted, compared with 69% of those eligible vaccinated and 50% boosted in the US. "What we see happening in the UK is going to be perhaps a better story than what we should be expecting here," Althoff said.In the Netherlands, it took about a month for BA.2 to overpower BA.1, she noted. If the same timeline occurs in the US, that will mean the variant is taking off just as the immunity generated by winter's Omicron infections will be waning. Coronavirus wastewater data, CDC guidelines can give mixed signals on whether to mask"I'm concerned about that," Althoff said. "But we were in a similar situation last spring, where we really got hopeful that things were going to settle down, and we got a little bit of a summer, and then we got walloped by Delta."It will be important for people to understand they may be able to take their masks off for a few weeks, Althoff said, but they might also need to go back to wearing them regularly if cases spike."We could see another wave of illness at our hospitals," she said.Althoff will also be closely watching wastewater data over the next few weeks.  "Wastewater surveillance is an incredible advancement in how we can monitor SARS-CoV-2 and what it's doing in the population without needing, really, any input from people," she said. "Keeping our eye on wastewater surveillance is an important tool to understand where the virus is going and if it's increasing in terms of infection."Preparing for the next waveProtection against the next variant has to start with vaccination."We absolutely have to continue to find people who are unvaccinated and get them vaccinated," Althoff said.Fauci agreed vaccination rates could be better in all age groups, but current numbers are especially bad for kids: Only about a third of kids ages 5 to 11 have been vaccinated and only about half of kids ages 12 to 17.Even though the youngest children, those under 5, can't yet be vaccinated, recent studies have shown young kids are less likely to catch Covid-19 when they're surrounded by vaccinated adults.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."So the way you protect them is to surround the children, to the extent possible, with people who are vaccinated and boosted so that you have somewhat a veil of protection around them," Fauci said.It will also be important to continue to be flexible."The important thing in this massive experiment where we're dropping all masking and restrictions is we have to stay diligent in terms of monitoring of it and testing and be prepared to possibly reverse a lot of the relaxing of these restrictions," said Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington."We can't let our guard down, because the message that people get when they say 'we're lifting restrictions' is the pandemic is over. And it's not," she said.
43,,(CNN)Things seem to be looking up as the US crosses into year three of the Covid-19 pandemic. Vaccines still do a good job of keeping people alive and out of the hospital. There's increasing access to tests and treatments. The numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are heading in the right direction.If living in a Covid world has taught us anything, however, it's that the coronavirus can surprise even the smartest public health experts, and the world certainly isn't out of the woods yet.A new variant could easily develop and slip past the protection of current treatments and vaccines, setting us back to what life was like in 2020. That makes it hard to predict what happens next week, let alone in a few months. However, based on what they're seeing now, here's what the experts think could happen in the next year of the pandemic. Each of these predictions has an unspoken "variant depending" at the end.What will spring and summer be like?Read MoreThe numbers in the US look good. Only 2% of the US population -- that's about 7 million  people -- lives in a county with a "high" Covid-19 community level, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rest are at "low" or "medium" community levels, areas where there's no recommendation to wear a mask or where the immunocompromised should take extra precautions.In fact, over the next four weeks, the CDC forecasts decreases in hospitalizations and deaths. The trend could continue, particularly as the weather improves and people head outside, where it's less likely that they'll catch Covid.These positive trends could mean the US will see a normal or at least near-normal spring and summer (variant depending, of course). She had a near-death experience because of Covid. But it wasn't a glimpse of an afterlife that changed her"I am very optimistic," said Dr. William Lang, WorldClinic medical director and former White House deputy physician. "I'm optimistic for what things look like for everybody being able to get back to normal activities over the summer."But normal doesn't mean a return to pre-2020 life. "Fewer" cases still mean tens of thousands of Americans are getting infected. And as of Friday, even with deaths at the lowest level in three months, there are an average of about 1,200 Americans dying from Covid-19 each day, according to Johns Hopkins University. "Everyone has to recognize, relatively speaking, we're still very early in this, right? This is not going away," said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Is America ready to take the next step in its Covid-19 recovery?If the pandemic moves into more of an endemic phase, meaning enough people have immune protection through natural infection and vaccination, it doesn't mean you can burn your masks. Rather, it means the spread of Covid will slow and result in fewer deaths and hospitalizations. But this state of endemicity is not guaranteed.One metric to watch is a rising trend in cases and hospitalizations in the UK. Karan thinks that is mainly happening because of waning immunity, and the US could see similar trends."With the combination of our immunity waning and the virus mutating, future surges are unpredictable," Karan said.  What about autumn and winter?With the unpredictability of the coronavirus, it's hard to know what will happen in the fall and winter, said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.READ: You asked, we're answering: Your top questions about Covid-19"This virus has thrown us some real curveballs," Montefiori said. Some experts say the coronavirus could eventually become seasonal like flu, but he doesn't think it's there yet. "Thinking of this as a seasonal virus like flu, that hasn't been the case so far. The variants seem to be periodic," Montefiori said. "Roughly every four to six months, we have a new variant." Pandemic at two years: Covid-19 news no longer dominates front pagesHe is optimistic, though, because Americans have so much immunity built up through vaccination, infection or a combination of the two. "We might have another surge later this year, even early summer, but if there isn't one, that's saying the immunity we've built up as a population is doing a good job."The concern, of course, is that a variant emerges that escapes the vaccines. "The good news is that vaccines can be quickly modified," Montefiori said.  With more access to tests and treatments now, many experts believe that the US is better prepared for a fall or winter surge than it was last year. Some say Covid-19 cases could climb for a while when colder weather sends people back inside and as they become more complacent about taking precautions. "Ultimately, the virus is going to have a tough time in our population, but it's going to take a long time," said Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. "I think the real long view is, endemicity is going to be the case. Eradication is not possible."Much depends on how quickly the planet can get vaccinated, Swartzberg said. The more people are vaccinated, the fewer there are to serve as hosts where the virus can mutate and produce -- you guessed it -- variants. Less than 10% of people in low-income countries are vaccinated, according to the International Rescue Committee. The US and other countries have pledged to send more vaccines overseas this year.    What's next for vaccines for adults?You may be need a fourth shot of the Covid-19 vaccine this year. The CDC already recommends that those who have weakened immune systems get one. Public health officials in the US have said they are very carefully monitoring if, or when, a fourth dose may be needed for the broader population, with a potential fall timeline in mind.The vaccines still seem to protect against hospitalization and death, particularly if you are boosted, but protection could wane over time and is a little less effective against the Omicron variant. The currently authorized boosters are made to protect against the original coronavirus from late 2019.The next vaccines could be specifically tuned to the variant -- or variants -- that are in circulation, Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Burton said Wednesday. Or they could be a combination shot.Moderna and Pfizer have confirmed that they are testing vaccines that focus on Omicron. This is no time to drop the ball on Covid-19Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company will soon submit data on another vaccine dose for federal health officials to consider. "I think our data suggests that they're protecting, they are improving dramatically the protection, the fourth dose compared to the third, for Omicron after some time, after let's say three to six months," Bourla said in a Washington Post Live discussion on Thursday. Globally, there are 234 other Covid-19 vaccines in development. Perhaps furthest along in the process is the one from Novavax. It is in the middle of the regulatory process with the FDA and could be authorized this year.What's next for vaccines for kids?Pfizer and Moderna are expected to report results from their trials involving children under the age of 5 in the next few weeks. Pfizer is also working on trials of a third vaccine dose for children ages 5 to 11. Children 12 and older can already get a third shot, as can kids 5 and older who are immunocompromised. For the littlest kids, scientists think a vaccine may not be authorized until April. Pfizer originally said it thought it could have one out earlier this year, but it added a third dose of the vaccine to its trials to see if it is more effective.  The vaccines can't come soon enough for some parents. During the Omicron surge, the largest increase in hospitalization rates was among kids ages 4 and under, according to the CDC.Global pandemic death toll is three times higher than reported Covid-19 deaths suggest, study findsBut many more kids for whom vaccines are now authorized still need to get them. They are the age group with the lowest vaccination rate in the US. "There still hasn't been nearly as much uptake as vaccines as we would want," said Dr. Shira Gertz, a pediatric critical care physician and researcher at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey. "Getting a vaccine is so much better than getting the disease."The politics of it might be tricky, but schools could require that kids get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they return to class in the fall, like they do with other diseases. Only a handful of schools currently do, like those in Los Angeles, the District of Columbia and New Orleans, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education. What's next for treatments and tests?There are 23 antivirals and 63 other treatments in late-stage clinical trials, according to Bio, a pharmacy industry association. Although Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for people as young as 5, treatments for children remain limited. It's begun a Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, in children ages 6 to 17. For treatments to work effectively, people have to get them quickly. The Biden administration's new test-to-treat program allows pharmacies with clinics to test someone for Covid-19 and immediately prescribe medication if they test positive. That program will play an even more vital role if cases surge again. What's next for masks?Hawaii is the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. That ends March 25. On Thursday, the federal requirement that people wear masks on public transportation, including planes, was extended for another 30 days.People may be sick of them, and masks have become a hot political subject, but broader mask mandates could always come back if case numbers rise and hospitals fill up.Masking is hugely effective. Research from January 2021 that analyzed several studies of mask use in adults found that masks reduced the transmission of the virus significantly. And a National Institutes of Health study published Thursday found that during the Delta surge, schools with mandatory masking had 72% fewer cases of in-school transmission than those with mask-optional policies."I think readers need to remember that even if we say 'this is what we're doing now,' we reserve the right to change stuff as needed," said Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York. Americans need to be flexible and adjust to the threat around them, she said.What about money for all these mitigation measures?Money to pay for the tests and treatments and vaccine research won't last forever, and more funding is not in the latest federal spending bill. The $15.6 billion earmarked for pandemic preparedness got stripped out. That was only half of what the Biden administration had asked for.The spending bill raises the CDC budget by $582 million, but it leaves out the pandemic waivers that gave schools extra federal funds to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks. The money that has bolstered many rural "safety net" hospitals expires soon. Safety net hospitals are those that, by legal obligation or mission, provide health care regardless of someone's ability to pay or insurance status. So more rural hospitals could close this year, and the US has already lost a record number of them during the pandemic. These business owners survived Covid. Now gas prices are surgingIt's a tenuous time. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said  supplies of therapeutics, testing and vaccines are finally at a level where they meet demand. "If there's issues with funding and any of those areas of progress start to fall off, we're going to be right back to the situation where we're playing catch-up and don't have enough," he said.On Wednesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, introduced a standalone Covid supplemental bill to manage the pandemic at home and around the world, but it's unlikely to pass.What about the long-term consequences of Covid?Scientists continue to study people with long Covid to try to understand the condition's symptoms and treatments. As many as 30% who've tested positive for the virus may have long-term symptoms like fatigue, breathing trouble, joint and chest pain, and heart problems, studies show. Mental health has been an ongoing challenge for adults and kids during the pandemic. Four in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, up from 1 in 10 before the pandemic. In communities of color, mental health issues are disproportionately undertreated. For kids, the Biden administration's national mental health strategy, announced this month, will try to address some provider and program shortages to address their needs.More than 206,800 children in the US have lost their primary caregiver to Covid, and advocates are also pushing for programs to address their needs.Will this ever be over?People need to be flexible and not let down their guard too soon, the experts say. "When places relax measures at the wrong moment, transmission spikes dangerously, and we lose more lives," Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Carissa F. Etienne said Wednesday, urging countries to base decisions on risk assessments and health data and to tighten public health guidance if cases start to rise.The bottom line, Lang said: Covid is here to stay, but the pandemic part could be in our rearview mirror -- or at least move into a more manageable stage -- if people get vaccinated and boosted. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."The Covid vaccine is much more effective in preventing deaths than the flu vaccine in preventing deaths," he said. "So, you know, we really can combat this thing by people getting vaccinated and boosted."Gertz also recommends that people pay attention to the numbers around them. "We have to continue to be diligent and aware of what's going on in our immediate surroundings," she said. That doesn't mean people will be in masks forever, but they should wear them when necessary, and take prevention measures like washing their hands. "Actually, we should always wash our hands."
44,,(CNN)To help fend off another wave of Covid-19, people will need a fourth dose of vaccine, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS on Sunday."Many variants are coming, and Omicron was the first one that was able to evade -- in a skillful way -- the immune protection that we're giving," Bourla told CBS' "Face the Nation.""The protection we are getting from the third (dose) it is good enough -- actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths," Bourla said. Here's what could lie ahead for the third year of the pandemic But protection after three doses is "not that good against infections" and "doesn't last very long" when faced with a variant like Omicron. "It is necessary, a fourth (dose) for right now," Bourla told CBS.Read MoreCurrently, anyone ages 12 and up who got a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least five months ago can get a third dose. Anyone ages 18 and up who got the two-dose Moderna vaccine should get a booster shot six months after the second dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And anyone who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster shot after two months, the CDC said.Some moderately or severely immunocompromised people who have had three doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines can already get a fourth dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.But it's not clear if or when the US Food and Drug Administration might authorize a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine for healthy teens and adults. "We are just submitting those data to the FDA, and then we'll see what the experts also would say outside Pfizer," Bourla told CBS.Kids under 5 might soon be able to get vaccinatedCurrently, children ages 5 to 11 are eligible for two pediatric doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine but are not yet eligible for a booster. Pfizer is testing a third dose in that age group now.When can younger kids be vaccinated against Covid-19? 'Not yet'And kids under age 5 are not yet eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine -- though that could change this spring, Bourla said. Initial trial data in children ages 2 to 5 showed two doses of a smaller, child-sized vaccine didn't give the expected immunity in the 2- to 5-year-olds -- though it did for babies ages 6 months to 2 years.So Pfizer decided to add a third child-sized dose for children under age 5 in its ongoing trial.Pfizer should have data on its three-dose vaccine trial for children ages 6 months to 5 years by April, Bourla told CBS on Sunday. If authorized by the FDA and recommended by the CDC, Covid-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months to 5 years might start as early as May, Bourla said. A shot at a longer-lasting vaccine against all variantsPfizer and Moderna have said they are working on a vaccine that would specifically protect against the Omicron variant. It's not clear yet if one is needed.Bourla said Pfizer is also hoping to make a vaccine that will protect against Omicron and all other variants of SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes Covid-19. The goal is to create "something that can protect for at least a year," Bourla told CBS on Sunday. "And if we are able to achieve that, then I think it is very easy to follow and remember so that we can go back to really the way (we) used to live," he said.CNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.
45,,(CNN)As we reach the second anniversary of the World Health Organization acknowledging Covid-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, we appear to be standing on the edge of the endemic phase of this global health crisis. For many, that's the moment when we hope we can get back to our regular lives.   Several times during this pandemic, I have written essays about America as if the country was my patient. The current situation has me thinking along those lines again.  Doctors, like anyone else, love to give good news. We see the value of hope but also recognize that honesty must be our North Star. I would love to be the good guy here and tell my patient that it's time to be discharged from this chapter of our lives. But a doctor's job is to fully assess the situation and lean into the nuance, as opposed to simple axioms. Time for a physicalSo let's examine America, the patient. On the one hand, the numbers are going down. Cases of Covid-19 are more than a third lower this week than they were last week and the lowest they've been since July, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.  And the number of people hospitalized is about a fifth of what it was during the country's mid-January peak. Even deaths, the so-called lagging indicator, have been falling; they're at their lowest point in two months. Read MoreAll 50 states are in the process of lifting restrictions. On March 26, Hawaii will become the last state to end its indoor mask mandate. Requiring masks in K-12 schools cut Covid-19 infections, study showsAt the federal level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made big changes in late February. Instead of primarily using  levels of coronavirus transmission within a community as the key metric for determining mask guidance, the agency recommends that three data points be considered instead: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and Covid-19 cases. So now, instead of a transmission map that paints most of the country an "inflamed" red, the community levels map shows a lot of cooler green and yellow, with a bit of orange -- the new low, medium and high categories. Since that change, there has been a big drop in the percentage of Americans living under masking recommendations, from 99% under the old metrics to just about 2% now.And at the start of the month, the White House unveiled its National Covid-19 Preparedness Plan. The new plan focuses on "vaccines, treatments, tests, masks," White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. "These tools are how we continue to protect people and enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines."As part of that, government testing and treatment initiatives are being streamlined and made more widely available. A closer lookBut in medicine, we cannot rely on lab results and a medical history. We need to perform a thorough and detailed exam. And when we do that, a more complete picture of the patient emerges.  First on CNN: Biden administration set to extend travel mask mandate for another monthTruth is, America, my patient still has an active infection. Although the numbers are falling, they are still painfully high: The country is averaging just under 37,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day. It's as if saying the patient used to have a very high fever but now only has a moderately high fever. The point is, it's still too high. We wouldn't stop treating the patient's infection at this point but rather complete the course of treatment and care.There's also the issue of understanding the effects the illness may have on my patient in the future. In this case, it means acknowledging an entirely new disease: long Covid. Many Americans are enduring the lingering effects of a past infection, battling health conditions like fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, cardiac issues. The list of long Covid symptoms is lengthy and varied; there are no answers as to who and why, nor are there easy, one-size-fits-all treatments. We are in the early days of this disease, but I was particularly struck by the recent paper indicating a previous Covid infection being a significant risk factor for future heart problems.And, even more important, there are still about 30,000 Americans hospitalized for Covid and, on average, more than 1,250 deaths a day. That's the equivalent of about two jumbo jets dropping out of the sky every day. My patient still needs lots of care.Other factors at playDespite the less red and inflamed transmission map, it still shows there's a lot of virus out there. If the virus came in the form of a raindrop, parts of our country would still be getting drenched. I have often imagined how different things would be if we could have actually seen the virus -- little green particles circulating around people's noses and mouths and becoming airborne. What if we had been able to witness its destruction and journey into blood vessels and lungs? This invisible enemy circumvented our basic human ability to detect a threat and, as a result, made us more likely to ignore and even deny it. Covid-19 safety tips to consider as you return to workI would remind my patient we have been here before. We experienced moments of genuine hope earlier and then witnessed how quickly things can change. In the summer of 2021, the Delta variant surprised us, and in December, Omicron blindsided us. Both times, the spikes caused by these variants followed declarations of victory heralding the end of the pandemic. Currently, there is a subvariant of Omicron called BA.2 that may spread even faster than Omicron itself. According to the latest figures from the CDC, it now makes up about 11.6% of Covid cases in the US; the week before, 6.6%. BA.2 is the dominant variant in Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa and more than a dozen other countries. According to the World Health Organization, studies estimate it is 30% more contagious than the original Omicron (BA.1).  And while studies suggest that BA.2 is not more likely to lead to hospitalization than BA.1, another patient that I've been keeping an eye on, the United Kingdom, is seeing cases and hospitalizations starting to trend up again after declining steadily since mid-January. Sometimes, doctors gain a lot of information from watching how other patients are faring. Podcast: Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta Again, I get it. I would love to look at these past two years in the rearview mirror as well, but we need to learn the lessons of this pandemic and apply that knowledge in real time. Today. Now.Delta and Omicron represent two cautionary tales in the span of a few months. It would be shortsighted to ignore that reality, believing it will never happen again.  A blend of science and judgment The International Epidemiology Association's Dictionary of Epidemiology defines a pandemic as "an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people."  Two years ago, when we made the decision to use the word pandemic on CNN, before the CDC or WHO, it was fairly straightforward -- fundamentally, it was an exercise in math and data analysis. My producers and I spent a lot of time looking at whiteboards where we kept tabs on the growing numbers and locations of Covid-19 cases. One day, I remember thinking, "If this isn't the very definition of a pandemic, I don't know what is. So why is no one else calling it that?"  And so we did.JUST WATCHEDDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020) 04:40 Although the line was clear entering the pandemic, it will be much fuzzier as we approach endemicity.  A disease is considered endemic when it is a "constant presence ... within a given geographic area or population group." It would also be predictable in its rate of spread without causing the level of disruption it does in a pandemic. But what is considered disruptive may be very different in one country compared with another, even from one person to the next. Progressing into this next phase will be based on a blend of science and judgment. What the exam reveals So if America were my patient, the question I would be asking: Is it really time to downgrade the country's present-day condition from pandemic to endemic? It's analogous in some ways to deciding when to discharge my surgical patients to the general care floor from the intensive care unit. This season's flu vaccine seems to be a poor match, early CDC data shows, but it's been a mild flu seasonI make rounds in the intensive care unit, carefully reviewing each patient's chart -- full of lab results, metrics and data. And then I sit at the bedside, watching, examining and understanding how they really feel. Can they stand on their own, put a fork to their mouth and a comb through their hair? Are their basic bodily functions returning to normal, and can they get by independently? It is a judgment call. Two people can have the same vital signs but be in very different places.     If America were my patient, what would I see when I sit at its bedside? Beyond 1,300 people dying a day, I would make note that almost 60,000 people died of Covid-19 during the month of February alone. In other words, more people died of Covid-19 in one month than die of the flu during a bad year.   So the question ultimately is: What is too disruptive? What are we willing to tolerate? At what point do we as a society throw up our hands and say, "We can't do any better than this," so let's call this level of sickness and death "endemic," accept the numbers and move on with our lives? And of course, my patient, America, lives on a planet with lots of other patients, all part of an intricate ecosystem. We must realize that America's health is dependent on the health of all the other patients on the planet: When any one of us is at risk, we are all at risk. Finding a measure of peace and quiescence None of this is easy. It's why epidemiologist and author Dr. Larry Brilliant said that "endemic" is a terrible word.  "Smallpox was 'endemic' when it killed somewhere between a third and half a billion people in the 20th century. Malaria is endemic, and it's killing millions. Tuberculosis is endemic. And HIV/AIDS was sort of thrown out of people's consciousness by just labeling it 'endemic,' " he said. Brilliant, who is CEO of Pandefense Advisory and a senior adviser at the Skoll Foundation, was a key player on the WHO team that eradicated smallpox.     Coronavirus wastewater data, CDC guidelines can give mixed signals on whether to maskHe pointed out that the technical definition of "endemic" is a disease that is generating an expected number of cases, to the expected community and the expected time. "And because [Covid-19] is a baby of a disease ... it's way too early to try to figure out what is endemicity. We have to wait for it to become a teenager and see how it behaves," he said.  Brilliant prefers the term "quiescent." "We want this thing to be quiet," he said. He recalled that in the early days of 2020, he and other epidemiologists and public health experts speculated that the illness would come in waves.  "A wave is a really good metaphor to think about this. Sometimes, the waves come in a bunch at a time, and sometimes there's not a wave for hours, even days. Some waves are too small to really be called waves. But every once in a while, there's a rogue wave, this tsunami."  Here's how to get free antiviral medicine if you test positive for Covid-19He explained, "what we want is the interval [between waves] to be long and the water in the waves to be quiescent. And that's what we're trying to say when people use the word 'endemic.' ... To say that the pandemic has gone endemic is failure -- it's not success. We haven't put it where we want it. So it's the wrong way of thinking about it." Plus, said Brilliant, saying that the pandemic is over means "we give up our duty of care."He believes we still have a duty of care to the immunocompromised, the elderly, the vulnerable and, yes, even the unvaccinated, because they are the ones disproportionately dying.  Life with an endemic disease Humans are increasingly living side by side with pathogens that were once in the wild but then took hold among us. We might not like it, and sometimes the pathogen comes too close for comfort, but we learn to live with it.  Take the parasite malaria. For millennia, it killed off wide swaths of the global population. In fact, the mosquito, which transmits the parasite that causes disease, is one of the most prolific killers of humans worldwide. Global Covid-19 deaths surpass 6 millionInarguably, the course of humanity has been shaped by malaria: It's believed to have contributed to the fall of Rome, and for hundreds of years, it helped protect Africa from European colonization even as it infected the local population. (And it's why the gene for sickle cell anemia, which is protective against malaria, never died off evolutionarily.) In this country, Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln grappled with it. The disease stunted the physical and economic growth of the rural South through the 1930s, and it is why the precursor to the CDC was founded.   It's an understatement to say man has been living with malaria for a very long time. And although we may not have eradicated it from the face of the Earth or completely tamed it, we have learned to coexist with it and reduced it to an endemic disease in a shrinking number of countries. The United States eradicated it in 1951.   How did we do that? By arming ourselves with knowledge. Through scientific research, we learned about where malaria comes from and how it is spread. We developed mitigation strategies and medications to blunt its impact.  And our work is still not done: In 2020, malaria killed an estimated 627,000 people, the vast majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa.Early detection, rapid responseMany experts, including Brilliant, are pretty sure that Covid-19 is here to stay. Like the common cold (also often caused by a coronavirus) or the flu, it's expected to be part of our lives for the next 10, 50 or 100 years, and life will never be quite the same again. Burnout may be changing your brain. Here's what to do But we can improve the situation and learn to live with it. "We want the disease to occur in places that we expect it, in the numbers that we expect, so we know how to deal with it," Brilliant said. "You can go to Hawaii on vacation and not worry. Your kids can go to school. And you don't need to worry about going to dinner with your parents or your grandparents. Maybe it's quiet and you have to still wear masks. Maybe it's quiet and you still have to be tested before you go someplace. But it's not on the front page every day." The key, said Brilliant, is two-part: early detection and rapid response.  For that to happen, we have to have good monitoring tools and be nimble going into and out of protective mode. Maybe that means we carry a mask in our coat pocket during wintertime, just like we take an umbrella when the forecast predicts rain; maybe we keep a box of rapid tests and a packet of antivirals in the bathroom cabinet for when we are under the weather; maybe we close a school but like we do with the flu -- with surgical precision, using a scalpel instead of a chainsaw.The good news, Brilliant said, is that moving forward, our tools -- vaccines, surveillance, tests, treatments, prophylactics -- will only get better. The inescapable fact is that we live in the era of pandemics. There are simply more and more opportunities for a pathogen, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to come in contact with the human population, make the jump and take hold. It's a dance we are increasingly doing because we are infringing more and more on the microbes' territory. Population growth, deforestation, climate change all contribute to this.

These pathogens are going to keep emerging in humans, but pandemics are not inevitable. Humans have evolved to create remarkable public health tools to prevent that, just as long we are smart and humane enough to use them.  My patient -- America -- is still in precarious health and will have to be careful moving forward to maintain all of the gains and continue making progress. Both the patient and doctors will have to remain vigilant and act quickly if there's any new infection. It's just not time for my patient to completely drop their guard, however much we would all like that to happen. We can and should be hopeful, but honesty must lead the way, full and transparent.

46,,(CNN)Just 2% of the United States population -- about 7 million people -- lives in a county where the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends universal indoor masking, according to the latest Covid-19 community level data, updated by the CDC on Thursday.This is 16 million fewer people than just last week, when about 7% of the US population lived in a county considered to have a "high" community level. Two weeks ago, when the CDC first released the new metrics, about 28% of the US population lived in a county considered to have a high community level. According to Thursday's update, nearly 73% of the US population now lives in a county considered to have a "low" community level, where there is no recommendation for masking. The remaining 21% live in a county considered to have a "medium" community level, where the CDC recommends that immunocompromised people and those at high risk for severe disease consider taking extra precautions against Covid-19.This data "can help counties make informed decisions and take appropriate public health actions," the CDC said in a statement. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Read MoreThe CDC's Covid-19 community level metrics are based on three things: new COVID-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and new COVID-19 cases. More than a third of the people who still live in counties considered to have a high Covid-19 community level are in Texas and Kentucky. Hidalgo County in south Texas is the most populous county to still have a high community level. Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced Tuesday that state mask mandate there will expire this month, making it the last state to drop this requirement.
47,,(CNN)The storyline of "The Gilded Age" begins less than 20 years after slavery was abolished in the US, and so the creative forces behind the historical series would have been well within their rights to feature a Black family struggling post Reconstruction.But, instead, there is the well-to-do Scott family, whose characterization is a breath of fresh air to many viewers, especially African Americans. "It means a great deal to me to have Black folks tune in to 'The Gilded Age' and to feel represented," Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the show's historical consultant and one of its producers, told CNN. "We're in a moment where we need to see dignity, where we need to reconcile with the violence and the trauma of segregation, of anti-Blackness, but also to see how these men and women who lived in the 19th century managed to live with that and still not be dehumanized by it."The parallels between that long ago time period and the highly-charged conversations being had in the country at the moment about race are hard to ignore.The HBO series (HBO is owned by CNN's parent company) takes place initially in New York City in 1882, with the struggle between the "old money" families and the newly rich who want entry into the elite society at its center.Read MoreOne of the characters, Peggy Scott, played by Denée Benton, is a young Black woman who is an aspiring writer.Viewers soon learn she is the daughter of successful parents played by stage-winning actors Audra McDonald and John Douglas Thompson.Armstrong Dunbar said it makes sense to portray such a family in a show about wealth, especially given that the Black elite and middle class are often "not considered when we're telling this kind of larger story about America and about Black America.""I feel like the Scott's story is a really nice counterweight to the storylines of the (wealthy and White) Russells or the van Rhijn households," she said. "And ultimately this is all about how people are attempting to find wealth, hold onto wealth and pass that wealth on to future generations."The historian credits the show's director and executive producer Salli Richardson Whitfield (who is Black) and creator Julian Fellowes with wanting to portray the Scott family. Fellowes is well known as the creator of "Downton Abbey" and his and Richardson Whitfield's involvement was one of the things that inspired Baltimore Sun journalist John-John Williams IV to watch "The Gilded Age.""I like ['The Gilded Age'] better than 'Downton Abbey' actually," Williams said. "They haven't just inserted a Black person in, like in traditional pop culture when you have the Black friend and they would have no story. They would just be on screen.""[The character of Peggy Scott] actually has her own life and her own story and she exists independent of the white lead and I think that's really important," he added. "She's a rich character with her own secrets and her own mysteries just like everyone else on the show and I think that's ideal. That's what makes the show really, really pop.""The Gilded Age" airs Mondays on HBO and streams on HBO Max.
48,,(CNN)A Florida judge on Monday blocked the release of certain records related to the death investigation of actor and comedian Bob Saget. According to court minutes obtained by CNN affiliate WKMG, Ninth Judicial Circuit Judge Vincent Chiu granted the Saget family's petition for the permanent injuction.    The judge's decision came nearly a month after Saget's family filed a lawsuit to block the release of some records, citing privacy concerns, as CNN previously reported. "The entire Saget family is grateful that the Judge granted their request for an injunction to preserve Bob's dignity, as well as their privacy rights, especially after suffering this unexpected and tragic loss. We are pleased this issue has been resolved, and the healing process can continue to move forward.  All of the prayers and well wishes continuously extended to the family are beyond appreciated," Saget family attorney Brian Bieber said in a statement to CNN.Saget, 65, was found dead in his hotel room in Orlando, Florida, in January. The Orange County Medical Examiner's Office determined that his death was accidental, most likely due to him falling backward and striking his head.Read MoreOn Monday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN The Orange County, Fla., Sheriff's Department completed its investigation into Saget's death and issued a final report on the matter. The report's findings are consistent with the medical examiner's initial ruling that Saget's death was accidental in nature, according to the source, who is not authorized to speak publicly about the matterThe document is subject to the court order barring the release of any new information about the comedian's death"There are no surprises in the report," the source said.Saget's widow Kelly Rizzo and her three daughters last month filed a lawsuit against Orange County's sheriff and the medical examiner's office, requesting that some investigation records related to the death be exempt from being revealed publicly because of their graphic nature in how they portray the late actor."In the process of these investigations, Defendants created records which include photographs, video recordings, audio recordings, statutorily protected autopsy information, and all other statutorily protected information," the lawsuit stated. "Upon information and belief, some of these Records graphically depict Mr. Saget, his likeness or features, or parts of him, and were made by Defendants during Defendants' investigations."The family argues in the lawsuit that the release of this information -- whether through a public records request or any other avenue -- would cause them to "suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress."CNN's Amy Simonson, Aya Elamroussi, Tina Burnside and Kate Conerlv contributed to this report.
49,,(CNN)Director Jane Campion has apologized to tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, calling a comment she made during her acceptance speech at Sunday night's Critics Choice Awards "thoughtless." The social media ire directed toward Campion over her speech for best director stemmed from one particular moment that came after she acknowledged the other nominees in the category, who were all men. "The Power of the Dog" helmer then said, "Venus and Serena, you're such marvels. However, you don't play against the guys, like I have to."In addition to being inaccurate (the tennis champions have faced off men), some perceived Campion's statement as being dismissive of two successful Black women's accomplishments. "I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved. I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world class athletes," Campion said on Monday in a statement via her representative. "The fact is the Williams sisters have, actually, squared off against men on the court (and off), and they have both raised the bar and opened doors for what is possible for women in this world. The last thing I would ever want to do is minimize remarkable women." Read MoreCampion's speech -- which was for one of four awards her Oscar-nominated film earned on Sunday -- began on a positive note, with Campion acknowledging the many "incredible" women present in the audience, including the Williams sisters. "What an honor to be in the room with you," she said, specifically addressing the pair, before asking them for tennis lessons.In her statement Monday, Campion reiterated her "love" for Venus and Serena Williams. "Their accomplishments are titanic and inspiring. Serena and Venus, I apologize and completely celebrate you," she said. It has been an up and down few weeks for Campion, whose film is a strong contender for best picture at the Oscars later this month. Last week, actor Sam Elliott expressed harsh criticisms of "The Power of the Dog" in a podcast interview, blasting the Western's "allusions of homosexuality." The Netflix drama, however, found many defenders in the aftermath against the comments -- naturally, its director among them."I'm sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. He's not a cowboy; he's an actor," Campion told Variety in response to Elliott's comments. "The West is a mythic space and there's a lot of room on the range. I think it's a little bit sexist."CNN's Hazel Tang contributed to this report.

52,,(CNN)Following what he calls a "heart incident," actor Bob Odenkirk is looking to another famous Bob for a new way to live.The "Better Call Saul" star talked about his collapse on set following a heart attack last year in a conversation on the "Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist" podcast.Odenkirk said the death of "Full House" and "Fuller House" actor and comedian Bob Saget, who was found dead in his Orlando, Florida, hotel in January at the age of 65, has influenced him. "I only met [Saget] one time and he really was a genuinely sweet guy who cared about other people," Odenkirk said. "And you could have a brief conversation with him and feel very connected very quickly. I would like to try to be a little more like him as I move forward."Saget's cause of death was determined to be "blunt head trauma," according to the autopsy report released by the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office.
53,,(CNN)Dolly Parton, one of popular music's most beloved stars, is taking herself out of the running for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's 2022 class of inductees. In a statement shared to her social media accounts, the country chanteuse said that while she was "extremely flattered and grateful" for the nomination, she didn't feel she'd "earned that right." "I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out," she said. Parton was the sole country star on this year's ballot, which also included Eminem, A Tribe Called Quest and Dionne Warwick. She said she hoped the hall of fame would consider her again one day if she's "ever worthy."The 2022 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nominees include Dolly Parton and A Tribe Called QuestRead More"This has, however, inspired me to put out a hopefully great rock 'n' roll album at some point in the future, which I have always wanted to do!" she said, noting her husband, Carl Dean, "has always encouraged [her] to do one."The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has made an effort in recent years to nominate and induct artists who aren't traditional rock artists but have made major contributions to popular music and influenced other musicians. Previously inducted artists who align more with other genres include The Supremes, Johnny Cash and Madonna. But it wasn't until 2007 that the hall of fame inducted its first rap group, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Earlier this year, when announcing the newest slate of nominees, Chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation John Sykes said the artists chosen each had "a profound impact on the sound of youth culture."The current criteria for inductees doesn't require them to record within the rock genre -- to be eligible, artists must have released their first commercial recording 25 years earlier. This year's inductees -- now down one likely shoo-in -- will be announced in May, with an induction ceremony to follow in the fall.
54,,Two years ago, Covid-19 turned the world upside down. While the pandemic is not over, The Best in Us is a series that highlights people whose pandemic stories exemplify the resilience of the human spirit. (CNN)Two years after his second project, the critically acclaimed "Care For Me," rapper Saba was ready to release his third full-length album.It was early 2020. The songs had been mixed and mastered; the videos shot; the rollout planned.You can guess what happened next. Rumors of a "novel coronavirus" turned into a global pandemic -- the world withdrew. And that album, the one Saba had been so ready to release, no longer felt necessary. "There was nothing wrong with that music," the 27-year-old told CNN. "But being in isolation, and thinking and spending so much time with myself and my own thoughts, I was like, 'Actually there's enough of this.' I don't want to contribute to the noise. I want to be intentional."But there was no blueprint for making art during a worldwide health crisis. Read MoreConstant news of record deaths while fearing for the health of loved ones was a unique stressor. Then there was the persistent racist violence against Black and Asian communities that not only didn't stop when the pandemic hit, it got worse. Still, artists persisted. In April, barely a month into the pandemic, indie folk act Thao & The Get Down Stay Down made a music video for their song "Phenom" completely over Zoom. Electropop artist Charli XCX made her album "How I'm Feeling Now" at home in quarantine, workshopping songs live on Instagram with fans. Members of Spillage Village, a hip-hop collective consisting of J.I.D, Earthgang, Mereba and others, rented a home together in Atlanta and spent months creating "Spilligion" in their de facto art commune.We had to depend less on the inspiration and more on the actual practice."Saba describes how it felt to make music during the pandemicEventually, Saba made his own album in the pandemic, too: "Few Good Things," which dropped last month, complete with an accompanying short film. But the realities of early quarantine made creativity elusive. In the past, you could get hit with sparks of inspiration just by being out and about, Saba said. When you're just sitting at home, it's harder -- you have to work to make the spark happen."We had to depend less on the inspiration and more on the actual practice," he said. "It's like going to the gym or something. You have to build a habit."Saba puts the finishing touches on "Few Good Things" in Revival Studio in Los Angeles in June 2021.So he, like many people, took to Zoom. Alongside friends and collaborators (fellow musicians Joseph Chilliams, MFnMelo, Frsh Waters, Squeak and Daedae), Saba cultivated a virtual writing group with a challenge to write a full verse, 16 bars, in 16 minutes. Soon, the group grew to about 12 people. Sometimes, they would meet multiple times a week, always holding each other accountable. The creativity, then, flowed from their community.When Saba started working on the new album, those larger sessions evolved into smaller ones between him and his two longtime producers, Daedae and Daoud. Because of the pandemic, they couldn't just rent time in studios, like they could with previous projects. While recording 2018's "Care For Me," for example, Saba and the others gathered in Oakland, California to work on the project and would spend weeks at a time in the studio. That wasn't possible anymore. Instead, they fed each other audio from their respective computers, miles apart, and built songs from scratch. There were some logistical issues, naturally -- the three-hour time difference between them made scheduling difficult, for example. But the distance also, quite tangibly, impacted the music.It's most notable on the song "Fearmonger," one of the tracks the trio made completely over Zoom. One person created the melody while another created the rhythm, but when they first played the riffs over the computer, there was a lag on Saba's end. What he heard was completely different from what Daoud and Daedae heard.Unlike in the past, Daoud (left) and Daedae only got together with Saba three times for studio sessions when working on the album.Later, when they sent the instrument stem files to Saba for arranging, he was confused. At first, he thought it was wrong. That's when they realized the issue. Saba arranged the track based on how he originally heard it -- speeding up the tempo as a result and creating a more funk-driven sound, different from anything they'd done in the past. That's the version on the album."Some things that happen in production or in song lyrics, some of it is random sometimes. Some of it is just based on a mood or a feeling," Saba said. "So working without that as the center of creation is ... what we had to find out how to do while we were making these songs on Zoom."Without the collaborative studio time, without concerts to connect with fans, Covid-19 forced many artists back to square one, Saba said. They had to look inward: What artist do you want to be? What songs do you like? What message do you want to send?The last two years have come with setbacks, of course. But it also pushed many artists to embrace being uncomfortable. It's easy to become stagnant, to become complacent, in your art. By forcing that discomfort, Covid-19 cultivated a new sense of exploration -- and that's where the best art comes from, Saba said. In that sense, the pandemic hasn't just been about finding new ways to be creative. For artists like Saba, it has reshaped their relationship with creativity altogether.
55,,(CNN)William Hurt, the Oscar-winning star of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," "The Big Chill," and "Broadcast News," has died, his son Will told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 71.Gerry Byrne, Hurt's friend, confirmed news of the actor's death to CNN."It is with great sadness that the Hurt family mourns the passing of William Hurt, beloved father and Oscar winning actor, on March 13, 2022, one week before his 72nd birthday," the family said in a statement obtained by Variety. "He died peacefully, among family, of natural causes. The family requests privacy at this time."No cause of death was shared by the family. Hurt was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018.Read MoreCNN has contacted Hurt's manager and publicist for comment.Hurt played a variety of roles in classic 1980s films including "Body Heat," "Children of a Lesser God," "Broadcast News" and "The Big Chill."His most recent roles on screen included General Thaddeus Ross in the Marvel films "The Incredible Hulk," "Captain America: Civil War," "Avengers: Infinity War," "Avengers: Endgame" and "Black Widow."His portrayal as a gay prisoner in South America in the 1985 movie "Kiss of the Spider Woman" earned him as Oscar as well as a BAFTA Film Award for best actor.Along with three additional Oscar nominations, Hurt -- who made his film debut in 1980 with Ken Russell's "Altered States" -- was nominated for two Emmys and six Golden Globes throughout his career, according to IMDb.

61,,(CNN)In an early scene from the new Pixar film "Turning Red," the character Mei hides out in the bathroom on a morning before school. Having spiraled from a particularly embarrassing encounter the night before, she's woken up to find that she's turned into a giant red panda.Mei's mother Ming assumes this reluctance to leave the bathroom means her 13-year-old daughter has just gotten her first period."Did the ... did the red peony bloom?" her mom asks through the door.Ming soon storms in with ibuprofen, vitamins, a hot water bottle and pads. Mei, unable to tell her mother what's really going on, endures an uncomfortable conversation about how she's now a woman and how her body is starting to change.Mei Lee is a 13-year-old girl who loves karaoke, her best friends and the boy band 4*Town. Mei is indeed undergoing a bodily transformation -- just not the one her mom thinks. As Mei soon discovers, she poofs into a furry red panda when she's overcome with emotion, reverting back only when she gets her emotions under control. Menstruation may not be what's ailing Mei, but the metaphor for periods, puberty and the ensuing emotional roller coaster is clear.Read MoreBy normalizing -- and even celebrating -- one of life's most awkward phases, "Turning Red" does something not often seen on film and television, especially media aimed at kids. It treats periods and female puberty as something to be embraced, rather than be embarrassed about.'Turning Red' normalizes periodsThough periods are an experience shared by half the world's population for a significant part of their lives, they're often regarded onscreen (when they're regarded at all) with fear, shame or disgust. It's a taboo that director Domee Shi was acutely aware of."You don't see that very often in movies and TV shows," Shi said in an interview with entertainment news site Uproxx, of the period talk between Mei and her mom. "And I think that's precisely why we wanted to put it in the movie. I mean, this movie is actually is for 13-year-old Domee that was in a bathroom, horrified, thinking that she had crapped her pants. And too afraid to tell her mom or ask anybody about what was going on."Mei's complicated relationship with her mother is at the heart of "Turning Red."While positive period portrayals in kids' and family-oriented movies and TV shows are rare, there are some notable examples. In a 1990 episode of "The Cosby Show," in which Rudy gets her first period, the youngest Huxtable rebuffs her mom Clair Huxtable's efforts to celebrate the occasion and turns to her friends for support. When the information she gets from her pals is faulty, it's Clair who steps in to reassure her that periods are completely normal.There was the 1991 episode of the sitcom "Blossom," which saw its titular character struggling to talk to her dad about her first period and wishing she had Clair Huxtable to guide her. A scene from the 1991 coming-of-age film "My Girl" features Vada screaming that she's hemorrhaging, only to be told that she's gotten her period. A 2001 episode of the animated series "Braceface" sees Sharon mistake her menstrual cramps for appendicitis. And in more recent history, the ABC sitcom "Black-ish" treats Diane's first period as an empowering experience.Still, these examples tend to be the exception, not the norm. Tackling the subject of periods feels especially radical for an animation giant like Pixar, given that 20 of the 24 films released by the studio center males. But by addressing menstruation with candor and levity, the creators of "Turning Red" intend to destigmatize it -- for everyone, not just young girls."The hope is with putting it on the screen and having it be something that is cringy, but also funny, and a part of this story, it does normalize it," producer Lindsey Collins told pop culture and gaming news site Polygon. "There's an appreciation from anybody who's gone through it for what we put on the screen, but also those who haven't gone through it."It also embraces the emotional extremes of pubertyBeyond periods, "Turning Red" explores puberty in all its uncomfortable glory -- through the eyes of a confident, goofy Chinese Canadian girl. In the words of Shi, it's an "Asian tween fever dream."Throughout the film, Mei navigates the awkwardness, excitement and embarrassment that come with changing hormone levels and manifest in her body as a red panda. She grapples with lust and attraction, crushing on the teenage convenience store cashier and members of her favorite boy band 4*Town alike. She imagines her objects of desire as mermen, then berates herself for doing so when her drawings are found out. She longs to see 4*Town in concert with her best friends, and vents to them angrily when her mom says no."From the very beginning, [I was] just really trying to not hold back with telling the story about a girl going through puberty. We're going to go there," Shi said in an interview with IndieWire. "From the very first version, it had pads, it had puberty, it had the weird boy crushes and drawings."Mei is just like any other girl navigating puberty -- except for the turning into a panda part.But perhaps the most profound challenge for Mei during this period of her life is figuring out how to be herself while also respecting the wishes of her parents -- a coming-of-age dilemma surely familiar to many children of immigrants. As Mei discovers more about who she is, she finds that parts of herself conflict with the image her mother has of her. Learning to accept those parts of herself, while finding the courage to stand up to her mother, is part of Mei's pubescent transformation, too.Shi has said she hopes that "Turning Red" helps girls and women feel seen -- and that it signals that periods, puberty and unwieldy emotions are simply a normal part of life.
62,,(CNN)Reuniting star-producer Ryan Reynolds and director Shawn Levy after their winning collaboration on "Free Guy," "The Adam Project" has the generic feel of a project created by committee, combining action, humor and smart-alecky one-liners in a way that's at best aggressively okay. That's probably enough for Netflix coming off a success with Reynolds in "Red Notice," but like the film's plot, this amounts to rehashing history.Reynolds neatly sums up "The Adam Project's" modest ambitions in the production notes, saying that the concept "ticked every box for us." That means giving the star a chance to be heroic and funny, while adding a dollop of heart that borders a bit too much on sappiness.The producers were equally shrewd in the casting, having Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo playing the Reynolds character's parents, serving up a bonus reunion of the 2004 rom-com "13 Going on 30."That said, the central relationship is actually between Reynolds' Adam and his 12-year-old self, played by Walker Scobell.Having lost his dad, the young Adam is warned by his mom that "The future is coming sooner than you think," but that can't possibly prepare him for what happens next: The elder Adam blasts into our time from 2050, employing time-travel technology to try stopping a villain (Catherine Keener) by altering the past in order to change the future.Read MoreThe kid not surprisingly has several million questions, and seems amusingly pleased that his scrawny, bullied self has grown up to be an accomplished pilot who's resourceful in a fight and not incidentally pretty ripped. (Reynolds, of course, played a pilot in "Green Lantern" before another superhero, "Deadpool," firmly established his current brand.)"We've seen 'Terminator,' right?" the older version asks the younger one, capturing the general irreverence toward the science-fiction underpinnings of the enterprise, which rather unabashedly approaches the time-travel aspect as a fertile comedic device and an opportunity to explore heart-tugging moments regarding family and words left unspoken.The back-from-the-future premise also includes a subplot involving Adam's lost wife (Zoe Saldaña, adding another Marvel veteran in a smallish role) and leads to some inordinately bad computer-generated de-aging graphics, the kind of shortcoming that's mildly distracting but easily ignored.Indeed, the underlying strength of "The Adam Project" is that it keeps serving notice not to overthink things, but rather to sit back and enjoy Reynolds' banter with his younger self as well as the colorful action.It's passable on those terms, but not much more than that, reflecting the pitfalls of Netflix's current movie strategy, which beyond a handful of prestige awards-seeking titles seemingly consists of attracting big promotable stars and volume, volume, volume."The Adam Project" recalls the past in cinematic terms by feeling conspicuously like what used to be dubbed a "B" movie, a genre that no longer has much traction in theaters. The modern twist on that is you needn't leave home, or directly pay extra, to consume its simple formula, stacked a rather rickety foundation of ticked-off boxes."The Adam Project" premieres March 11 on Netflix.
63,,(CNN)Actor Jussie Smollett is headed to jail for lying to police and orchestrating a hate crime hoax, but with his legal proceedings largely over, the questions now turn to the former "Empire" star's future in Hollywood.On any potential return to acting, a Smollett family representative told CNN, "clearly he would like to" but also that at the moment "everything is up in the air."Hollywood is no stranger to handing out redemption to talented men and women who make mistakes, whether it be an offense that lands them in Twitter jail or actual jail. The question is whether Smollett will clear the invisible bar set for him to make his way back onto screens big and small or end up on a list of uncastable actors. There are indications that at least some notable figures in Hollywood have not distanced himself from Smollett, who got his start in the industry at 12 years old in a short-lived ABC's sitcom in which he starred alongside his siblings. At a hearing on Thursday, at which Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, Smollett's team presented the judge with letters of support from actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya, among others. Read MoreIn their letter, the couple argued that Smollett should be spared jail time and that the 39-year-old "has already suffered a great deal of punishment as this situation has destroyed his existing career and impuned his reputation." Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett, arguably the most acclaimed of the family's six entertainer siblings, remains well connected and regarded in the industry, as well. Even as the family navigated Jussie Smollett's legal troubles, she was among the cast of HBO's horror drama "Lovecraft Country," which debuted in 2020. (CNN, like HBO, is owned by WarnerMedia.) It was on the press tour for that series that the actress, known for her past roles on shows like WGN's "Underground" and HBO's "True Blood," publicly opened up about her brother's scandal in detail and reiterated her support for him.Smollett was found guilty back in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that in January 2019, two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime and at the time, celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly.  That support wavered as the incident's twists and turns played out, particularly as investigators soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama "Empire" to stage the incident for publicity.On Thursday, the silence from some of Smollett's original defenders was deafening.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown was an exception. Among those who expressed her "love" for the Smollett family in 2019, Brown shared her thoughts once again on Friday, tweeting, "The way that judge reprimanded Jussie, you'd think he murdered 2 people or used a gun instead of a taser on a Black man at a traffic stop." Smollett's attorneys have indicated they intend to appeal.CNN's Jason Kravarik and Brad Parks contributed to this report.

65,,(CNN)Alicia Keys' hit song "Girl on Fire" is taking its message of female empowerment to a new audience.The Grammy winner spoke to CNN about how her 2012 single inspired her new graphic novel of the same name. "'Girl On Fire' is such a special song ... I mean, who knew that this song would have this kind of energy, that it would hold and create," Keys told CNN in an interview this week. "[The book] has been in the works for about five years. It felt like it would be so beautiful to really go deeper into the story of a girl on fire named Lolo, who is being raised in Brooklyn. She's 17 years old. She has a single father who's raising herself and her brother and her brother ended up getting harassed by a police officer. Out of the anger and the desire to protect her brother, she discovers that she has this power that she never knew she had."The novel's illustrations were done by Britney Williams and Keys' co-writer is Andrew Wiener."You go on to discover more about her [Lolo], her family and the neighborhood and who she's actually battling," Keys added in describing the project. "I think the metaphor is that we all have a superpower and what are we gonna do with it? You know, how are we gonna discover it?"Read MoreKeys said she's already thought about potentially developing the graphic novel into a film or television series."Some people are very good at the novel situation and can kind of have their imagination run wild. Some people really want to be immersed in a world that they can see the color and they can read it on the page," Keys said. "I think that does lend itself very much to potential films, potential series, all these pieces of this incredible girl Lolo that represent all of us."
66,,(CNN)Obi-Wan Kenobi is coming to streaming, as practically anyone with an internet connection knows by now. But is that the ideal venue for a project based on a beloved original "Star Wars" character? And while he might insist "It's not my fault!," how much of the blame goes to Han Solo?These are some of the imponderable questions raised by the funneling of resources to streaming services, with "Obi-Wan Kenobi" -- a limited series in which Ewan McGregor reprises his role from the second trilogy -- due to land on Disney+ in May.Watching the very enticing trailer, it's easy to see this concept as a major movie, and fans flocking to theaters for a story set during that period in which Kenobi quietly watched over a young Luke Skywalker, a decade after "Revenge of the Sith" and before the two meet in "A New Hope."Indeed, the first thought consuming the trailer -- especially when those strains of composer John Williams' "Duel of the Fates" kicked in -- was just how big an opening weekend a movie version would have registered at the box office.Alas, we'll never know, as Disney has prioritized producing must-have content for Disney+, which has outpaced even the most ambitious projections for its growth, reaching nearly 130 million subscribers. At roughly $7 a month, that's a whole lot of credits, and "Star Wars" shows, like "The Mandalorian," are obviously a major part of that.Read MoreStill, Disney is in the theatrical business as well, where hits have become increasingly elusive, a trend that preceded the pandemic but that has been significantly exacerbated by it. Increasingly, there appears to be a very narrow tier of blockbusters -- "Spider-Man: No Way Home" and "The Batman" among the recent examples -- that can overcome the gravitational pull of streaming's tractor beam. For everything else, it's wait until Netflix or one of its competitors offers it.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the upcoming Disney+ series.An Obi-Wan Kenobi movie, starring McGregor, would seem to have the combination of elements to clear that hurdle. Instead, the studio opted to go the Disney+ route after the disappointing box-office performance by "Solo," a 2018 prequel that cast Alden Ehrenreich in the title role.At the time, Collider reported that Disney and Lucasfilm had decided to put all the "Star Wars" spinoff movies "on hold" because of "Solo's" commercial misfire, which prompted headlines like "'Solo' Is Officially the First 'Star Wars' Movie to Flop." That included what was then planned to be an Obi-Wan feature."I just think that we might've put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast," Disney's then-CEO, Bob Iger, told the New York Times.Saturating the market was likely a factor. Arguably, though, the studio might have overreacted, in the process underestimating the appeal of the Kenobi character and the lure of having McGregor (as opposed to a recast newcomer) reprise the role.While it's fun to speculate and play "What if?," it will be virtually impossible to sort out whether Disney left money on the outer rim by producing a limited series instead of a movie. People sign up and maintain streaming subscriptions for all sorts of content, although it seems fair to surmise that "Star Wars" fans won't cancel Disney+ any time before "Kenobi" finishes its run.The series, incidentally, premieres on May 25, which happens to be the 45th anniversary of the Jedi knight's debut in "Star Wars," back in the day before chapter subheads were involved, when people's at-home alternatives were mostly limited to the three broadcast networks.Would a Kenobi movie, released on that anniversary with the kind of trailer that just broke the internet, bring people out to theaters today? Let's just say that if Disney had stuck to its original plans, even with all that's happened to movie-going, they'd be justified in having a good feeling about this.
67,,(CNN)Alec Baldwin's says in a legal filing Friday that Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer on the set of "Rust," told him to cock the gun that ultimately fired a live round of ammunition, resulting in her death.CNN has obtained the arbitration demand filed by Baldwin's lawyer which describes in detail Baldwin's version of the moments that led up to the fatal shooting last October in New Mexico. In it, Baldwin claims that he asked Hutchins if he should cock the gun and that she told him to do it."Baldwin asked Hutchins whether she wanted to see him cock the gun, as the script required. She responded yes. Baldwin tipped the gun down somewhat so that the lens of the camera would be able to focus on his hand's action on the top of the gun. While performing this action, Baldwin asked Hutchins, 'Am I holding it too far down?' and 'Do you see that?' Hutchins responded that she could see Baldwin's action from her angle. Baldwin then pulled back the hammer, but not far enough to actually cock the gun. When Baldwin let go of the hammer, the gun went off," the filing says.Attorneys for Hutchins' family told CNN in a statement:"Alec Baldwin once again is trying to avoid liability and accountability for his reckless actions before and on Oct 21st that resulted in the death of Halyna Hutchins, as demonstrated by today's arbitration demand for indemnification from the Rust production company.  Baldwin's disclosure of personal texts with Matt Hutchins is irrelevant to his demand for arbitration and fails to demonstrate anything other than Hutchins' dignity in his engagement with Baldwin.  It is shameful that Baldwin claims Hutchins' actions in filing a wrongful death lawsuit derailed the completion of "Rust." The only action that ended the film's production was Baldwin's killing of Halyna Hutchins."Read MoreThe court documents also claim that when Baldwin arrived on the New Mexico set, he underwent a training session with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and that he understood from that session that he did not need to check the gun for live ammunition. "Reed did not instruct Baldwin to check the gun himself. In fact, she told Baldwin that it was her job to check the gun—not his," the documents read. "Similarly, Baldwin believed, based on prior gun safety training he received on movie sets, that actors should not unilaterally check guns for live ammunition. If actors want to check a gun for their own peace of mind, they should only check the gun with the armorer closely supervising the process. In other words, actors may jointly inspect a gun with the armorer, but never on their own."CNN has reached out to representatives for Guiterrez Reed.The legal filing Friday also includes numerous text messages between Baldwin and Matthew Hutchins following the shooting, up until Baldwin's ABC interview. Two weeks following his sit-down, Baldwin's final text to Hutchins was to wish his son a happy birthday."Since October 21, Baldwin had offered comfort and support to Matthew Hutchins and his son, as well as constructive input towards a settlement of the case," Baldwin's arbitration filing states. "He has worked extensively to find ways to help Hutchins and his son. It is that same spirit that renders Baldwin reluctant to contradict some of Matthew Hutchins's public statements. Unfortunately, given the nature of Hutchins's accusations against Baldwin, he has no choice."CNN a representative for Rust Movie Productions LLC.
68,,(CNN)Singer Grimes and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have welcomed their second child together, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk. The little girl was born via surrogate in December last year, Grimes revealed in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair, published on Thursday. Although the 33-year-old Canadian musician apparently had no intention of announcing the birth of their second child, nicknamed "Y," she shared the news after Vanity Fair journalist Devin Gordon overheard a baby crying. Kim Kardashian's business advice for women sparks controversy: 'It seems nobody wants to work these days' Grimes and Musk previously welcomed a son named X Æ A-Xii -- pronounced: "X A.I. Archangel," or "X"-- in May 2020.  Musk, 48, has five other children -- twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Saxon and Kai -- from a previous marriage. Read MoreThe couple broke up in September 2021, but Grimes -- born Claire Elise Boucher -- described their relationship status as "very fluid." "There's no real word for it," she told Vanity Fair. "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid. We live in separate houses. We're best friends. We see each other all the time ... We just have our own thing going on, and I don't expect other people to understand it." Jussie Smollett sentenced to 150 days in jail for lying to police in hate crime hoaxOn Thursday, Grimes told fans that her Vanity Fair cover story was intended to speak about her work, not to discuss her personal life. "Def held back a lot, contrary 2 headline," she tweeted, adding: "& didn't mean for them 2 find out about my daughter so please respect her privacy as I'd love her to be able to live as private of a life as possible." She later clarified her relationship status in a separate tweet, saying she and Musk had broken up again since the Vanity Fair article was written, but she added that Musk was "my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now, I think Devin wrote that part of the story rly well.

"I think if you grew up in Beverly Hills with super successful parents in what was simply a smaller mansion... nobody needs to hear your thoughts on success/work ethic," Jamil tweeted.
70,,(CNN)In Batman lore, the police summon the hero by projecting a magnified Bat-signal across the night sky. That's a fitting metaphor for the character's much-debated history in movies, which has cast an unusually large shadow thanks to fans convinced, in their minds, precisely how the Dark Knight should be depicted.Created in 1939, Batman isn't the first superhero or even necessarily the best. But different approaches to adapting him for the screen have provoked inordinate passion among fans, including knee-jerk reactions that border on the hysterical. That included the howls that greeted casting Michael Keaton in the 1980s (admittedly an unorthodox choice) and perhaps especially Ben Affleck in 2013.In a December interview with Howard Stern, Affleck admitted feeling "hurt" by an online petition that circulated opposing him starring in "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice." For his part, Stern pointed out that Batman aficionados have a track record of complaining "no matter who gets that role."Through the years, fans seeking fidelity to the comics have had reason to be wary and suspicious of Hollywood.The key window for Batman in comics came in the 1970s, which marked shift from the lightness and camp that characterized the 1960s "Batman" TV show -- with its "Wap! Bam! Pow!" graphics -- to a darker vision of the caped vigilante.Read More"The Batman," starring Robert Pattinson, represents the latest screen incarnation of the character, and in many ways feels designed to tap into the desires of that ardent fan base. Brooding and serious, the film caters to those weaned on Batman as a creature of the night, an image honed by comic-book artists Marshall Rogers and Neal Adams in the '70s, and Frank Miller in the landmark graphic novel "The Dark Knight Returns."Director/co-writer Matt Reeves has cited another comic written by Miller, "Batman: Year One," which captures an early stage in his crimefighting career, among his inspirations.Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Zack Snyder's Justice League.'Those comics evolved Batman's profile toward a more adult tone that informed director Tim Burton's 1989 movie. Yet even with its success, sequels directed by the late Joel Schumacher -- starring Val Kilmer, and then George Clooney -- revived the kind of broader camp that many comics fans saw as the bad old days.Christopher Nolan rectified that with his trilogy of "Batman Begins," "The Dark Knight" and "The Dark Knight Rises," which featured Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning take on the Joker -- the kind of prestige that usually eludes superhero fare.But reinvention has always been a part of Batman's screen incarnations. Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Picture Group (like CNN, part of WarnerMedia), recently told the New York Times that Reeves' challenge was to "create a Batman that is compelling and dynamic and thrilling, but different than anything we've seen before."While the movie is assured of a big opening weekend, how well it lasts will be determined not just by how committed fans respond, but whether those less invested join them in marching back to theaters.When Affleck was selected, CNN's Jake Tapper jokingly introduced a segment on the overheated response as "the debate tearing this country apart: Batfleck." The next year, Affleck conceded to Entertainment Weekly that Warner Bros. warned him about possible blowback, quoting studio brass as saying, "Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions." Social media has fueled that dynamic, creating echo chambers where those holding "a lot of opinions" can commiserate with like-minded souls, or conversely, argue with dissenters.The loudest voices, of course, aren't always the most representative, especially with something like Batman. But they do reflect why that Bat-signal occupies such a distinctive place in pop culture: Because so many people think they know what's right for the character, believing that he -- no matter who wears the costume -- belongs to them.
71,,(CNN)Pixar has a knack for coming-of-age tales, but few that mix the touching and adorable much better than "Turning Red," a bright and appealing animated movie somewhat surprisingly headed directly to Disney+. Audiences should still warm to this mother-daughter story on streaming, but in bypassing theaters it feels like the studio is leaving some green on the table.Directed and co-written by Domee Shi (the theatrical short "Bao"), the film tells the story of 13-year-old Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose family runs a Chinese temple in Toronto. An honor student who craves the approval of her mother (Sandra Oh), Mei has a trio of close friends with whom she shares a passion for a boy group named 4*town, which will soon be playing a concert in her town.Budding boy mania, however, triggers another unexpected response: Mei's transformation into a furry Red Panda, a legacy of her family's mystical history. The parallels between that and the advent of puberty are unavoidable, and Shi and co-writer Julie Cho hilariously lean into them, with Mei's introduction to dawning womanhood bringing with it a series of mortifying side effects.In tone and style, "Turning Red" perhaps most closely resembles "Inside Out," another Pixar film that did an inordinately good job of addressing the pangs of this particular age in a sprightly and entertaining package. Here, the add-ons include not only a generational clash but the weight of expectations that Mei faces, trying to satisfy her mother as she begins to exhibit signs of independence."Turning Red" also gets a whole lot of mileage out of the panda gags, which, in the crassest commercial terms, should sell a whole lot of plush toys to younger tykes.Read MoreLike the best Pixar fare, the film operates on multiple levels, in ways that will be relatable to parents and older kids that are both culturally specific and broadly universal, with the added garnish of original songs by Billie Eilish.Animation has obviously been a major driver for Disney+ over the past two years, at a time when the streaming service needed content and viewers were hungry for escapes at home.Whether that logic holds as theaters are opening up is between Pixar and Disney's accounting teams, but the lack of a theatrical window right now is puzzling, with a movie that's qualitatively in the conversation with the Oscar-winning "Soul," and a cut above recent releases "Luca" and "Onward."Still, wherever one sees it, "Turning Red" delivers an exquisitely animated story that's moving as well as funny -- welcome evidence that creatively speaking, at least, Pixar hasn't lost its golden touch."Turning Red" premieres March 11 on Disney+.
72,,(CNN)The equivalent of missing what should be an easy layup, "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" stumbles on the road to greatness, undermining can't-miss subject matter for basketball fans with an uneven, at times farcical tone. Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.Produced by "Don't Look Up's" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin "Magic" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.What came to be known as the "Showtime" Lakers (a title left unused by HBO for obvious reasons) featured a larger-than-life collection of personalities, and a series of soap-opera-worthy twists, like coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke) quitting, but still hanging around; and new coach Jack McKinney (Tracy Letts) suffering a devastating accident that left overwhelmed assistant Paul Westhead (Jason Segel) in charge.Still, "Winning Time" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of a jerk.Read MoreTo be fair, the series settles down a bit after that (eight of the 10 episodes were previewed), focusing on fleshing out individual players, from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes, a mere 6'11") to Buss' daughter Jeanie (Hadley Robinson), treated abysmally by her direct bosses because she's the owner's kid.John C. Reilly as Dr. Jerry Buss in 'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.'There are some memorable moments scattered along the way, such as Buss' encounter with Boston Celtics president Red Auerbach (Michael Chiklis), who sizes up the real-estate mogul as a dilettante and dismisses him as any threat to the Celtics' aspirations. Reilly also makes the most of Buss' flamboyance, spending almost drunkenly as he hangs off the edge of a financial cliff and assures everyone who asks, "Let me worry about the money."For those wondering, most of the actors are roughly six inches shorter than their real-life counterparts, but the basketball sequences -- and the clever washed-out tones used in shooting the entire production -- work quite well. Isaiah captures Johnson's charisma and infectious enthusiasm, but also his competitive streak, particularly given the attention showered on fellow rookie superstar Larry Bird (Sean Patrick Small), the league's "great White hope."Yet despite its all-star lineup, which includes Sally Field as Buss' mother and Adrien Brody as future coach Pat Riley, "Winning Time" plays too fast and loose -- approaching its material with an irreverence, from snippets of animation to cheeky on-screen chyrons, in a way that's periodically off-putting. What should be catnip to those who watched ESPN's docuseries "The Last Dance" misses that target, winding up in a creative no-man's land.Buss does emerge as a visionary, someone who recognized the NBA's potential and Johnson's magnetism not just to win titles, and thanks to the rivalry with the Celtics, elevating the entire league's fortunes.It's a high-stakes, fact-based story that requires scant embellishment, one that could do for sports what "Succession" does for media.That blue-chip roster, however, only makes "Winning Time's" shortcomings more glaring. While the Lakers rose to the occasion, the series falls short of its potential in terms of conjuring premium-TV magic."Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" premieres March 6 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Red Auerbach as the owner of the Boston Celtics. During the period covered in the show he was the general manager, not the owner.
73,,(CNN)"Lucy and Desi" puts a big heart around Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, not only as the beloved stars of "I Love Lucy" and one of Hollywood's great power couples, but as TV pioneers. Drawing upon personal recordings and home videos, director Amy Poehler has served up a warm valentine that leans into celebrating their lives and away from the tabloid fodder.The documentary obviously serves as a sort of irresistible and logical companion to writer-director Aaron Sorkin's recent Amazon movie "Being the Ricardos," although in ways it's even more nostalgic and sentimental. In terms of Arnaz's serial infidelity, for example, it's basically left to their daughter, Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill, to note that her parents hurt each other -- him with his actions, and her with words.What "Lucy and Desi" achieves most effectively is to capture the respective genius that the two brought not just to their show -- which originated the multicamera sitcom format -- but as producers more broadly. Detailing their respective backgrounds, it also presents their parallel rises to stardom before meeting on the RKO musical "Too Many Girls," with Arnaz recalling seeing Ball and thinking, "Oh man, that's a hunk of woman."Like many a show-business romance, their whirlwind courtship and marriage flamed brightly and fizzled, with each lasting much longer with their second spouses than they did with each other."To the rest of the world a Hollywood couple has no problems," Ball says. "Of course, we do."Read MoreJUST WATCHED'Being The Ricardos' goes backstage with Lucy & DesiReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Being The Ricardos' goes backstage with Lucy & Desi 01:37Poehler does a terrific job of contextualizing (or 'splainin,' as Ricky might say) what made each special, with Carol Burnett describing Ball as "fearless in her comedy," and others discussing Arnaz's natural gifts as a producer that certainly weren't obvious when he was making a living beating a conga in clubs."Lucy and Desi" doesn't shy away from darker aspects exactly, or the troubles associated with the times. Arnaz reminisces about his excesses by citing regret about a lack of moderation, saying, "I either worked too hard or I played too hard." Network executives, meanwhile, were nervous at first about how audiences would respond to seeing the Latin Arnaz as Lucy's husband, and later (as covered in the recent movie) by Ball's connection to the Red Scare.Nevertheless, Poehler and writer Mark Monroe tend to accentuate the positive, incorporating truly stirring moments that even most fans of the show might not have seen or recall. There's Ball's Emmy acceptance speech for "The Lucy Show" in 1967 (11 years after her second win for "I Love Lucy"), her teary-eyed tribute at the Kennedy Center, and Arnaz Luckinbill recounting Lucy and Desi's final conversation shortly before her dad's death.Ultimately, it's an uplifting story of truly self-made talents who found each other, clawed their way to the top and helped birth something that, as the recent flurry of activity surrounding the show suggests, has survived them by decades.Arnaz is said to have chafed at Ball's fame at the time, but their mutual admiration comes through loud and clear. And while their marriage didn't endure, watching the clips roll by merely underscores that "I Love Lucy" is forever."Lucy and Desi" premieres March 4 on Amazon.

This means many of them are available to watch now, including "The Power of the Dog," which led among nominated films with 12 nods, and "Coda."Several best picture nominees are not available for streaming yet, but "Belfast," "Drive My Car" and "Licorice Pizza" can be viewed via digital rental. The same goes for "Dune" and "King Richard," which were featured on HBO Max but have since left the platform. "West Side Story" will soon land on Disney+, as noted below.For those eager to catch up on the major contenders, here's where you can currently find them:NetflixRead MoreMeryl Streep stars as President Janie Orlean in "Don't Look Up."Best picture: "Don't Look Up," "The Power of the Dog."Best actor and actress: Andrew Garfield ("Tick, Tick ...

75,,(CNN)The Oscars are about honoring the year's best movies, but they're also a TV show, devoted to attracting an audience that will benefit host network ABC and promote the movie business. And after record-low ratings in 2021, the old adage about the Lord helping those who help themselves comes to mind.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is surely feeling pressure to breathe some life back into ratings for the Oscars, and part of that plan has logically involved nominating movies that more people have actually seen. Yet despite expanding the best-picture category to 10 nominees, few of the major contenders in the nominations unveiled Tuesday morning meet that description -- especially if it means having seen those films in theaters.Before the nominations, producer Cassian Elwes -- known for smaller-scale films like "Mudbound" and "Lee Daniels' The Butler" -- tweeted that it was "shortsighted" for the Producers Guild's awards to overlook "the two terrific movies that saved the theatrical business this year," "Spider-Man: No Way Home" and "No Time to Die."If you subscribe to that theory, the Oscars will be inordinately reliant on movies that have primarily reached audiences through streaming, with two Netflix titles, "Don't Look Up" and "The Power of the Dog," among the 10 nominees, joined by Apple's "Coda," and "King Richard" and "Dune," which premiered simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. (The last two are from Warner Bros., like CNN, part of WarnerMedia.)As for the aforementioned movies that "saved the theatrical business," "Spider-Man" -- currently the fourth biggest domestic box-office release of all time -- received a lone nomination for visual effects, while Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007 was recognized for best song, sound and visual effects.Read MoreGranted, the belief that popular movies are key to boosting Oscar ratings doesn't always hold true, although the most-watched telecast ever remains the year that "Titanic" sailed away with best picture. Yet it seems undeniable that hit films broadly help, giving potential viewers more of a rooting interest in who and what wins.Mindful of that, the Academy flirted with introducing a "popular film" category in 2018, seeking to add a more populist streak to the ceremony. After members shot down the idea for various (mostly logical) reasons, the organization opted to expand the best picture category to 10 movies, in part hoping that at least a few widely seen titles would sneak into the mix.Smaller movies, however, have generally prevailed. And part of the challenge that the Oscars and the movie business face has stemmed from the consumer pivot to streaming, a trend that was already growing before being dramatically hastened by the global pandemic.Hidetoshi Nishijima and Tôko Miura in 'Drive My Car,' which received Oscar nominations for best picture and international film.For theaters worried about their future, the fact that people interested in catching up on nominees will find "The Power of the Dog" (this year's most-nominated title, with 12) and "Don't Look Up" on Netflix -- along with others that earned major nominations, including "Tick, Tick ... Boom!" and "The Lost Daughter" -- won't ease those concerns.Because streamers generally don't provide detailed viewing data, it's unclear how many people have seen some of these movies, but they're obviously being watched via those platforms in vast numbers. Witness the Billboard-topping songs from "Encanto," a nominee for best animated movie, which took off once that title landed on Disney+.While blockbusters (other than the sci-fi epic "Dune," a more modest box-office performer) remain scarce in the best-picture category, the Academy did recognize an international movie, Japan's critical darling "Drive My Car," as well as its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi. That follows the historic best-picture win by "Parasite" two years ago.In addition, the Danish animated documentary "Flee" registered an impressive showing, notching nominations in the animated, documentary and international film categories.The Academy's ongoing efforts to be more representative in terms of diversity and inconclusion continue to yield mixed results, with some notable oversights (see Ruth Negga for Netflix's "Passing") but major acting nominations for Denzel Washington ("The Tragedy of Macbeth"), Ariana DeBose ("West Side Story"), and Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis ("King Richard").Inevitably, the omissions will receive as much attention as the nominees, but by now it should be clear that the Oscars can never please everybody, especially with 10 best-picture nominees and only five slots for directors.Whether that somewhat disjointed roster adds up to a menu that will lure back more viewers remains to be seen. But if the Academy does see ratings rebound, the hero will be streaming, not Spider-Man.
76,,(CNN)Cameron Smith claimed the PGA Tour's biggest payout on Monday after winning the Players Championship. The 28-year-old finished a shot ahead of Anirban Lahiri at TPC Sawgrass, going home with the winner's check of $3.6 million.Smith carded a six-under 66 to finish 13-under for the tournament and claim his second title of the season and fifth of his career. When asked what he was going to do with such a large amount of money in the press conference afterwards, Smith hadn't yet made up his mind. "I really don't -- I don't have an answer for that. It hasn't sunk in," he said with a smile. Read More"That's a lot of money. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it."Smith lines up his putt on the fourth hole during the final round of the Players Championship.The win held even more significance for Smith given who was within the crowd. Amongst the fans watching Smith claim victory in Florida were his mother and sister, who he said he hadn't seen in two-and-a-half years.Smith, who lives in Florida, explained that "golf was second for these few weeks.""It's really cool to have them here. My main priority really was just to hang out with them and golf was second for these few weeks."It's nice to see them and nice to get a win for them."The tournament -- one of the PGA Tour's marquee events -- was severely delayed due to inclement weather, with rain, darkness and lightning meaning it had to be finished on Monday rather the traditional Sunday final day. When play resumed early on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field had to complete their third rounds.And after a quick turnaround, Smith began his final round strongly with a huge 38-foot birdie putt on the first hole. He registered five birdies in his opening six holes, before three consecutive bogeys from the seventh hole weakened his grip on the lead. But, under huge pressure, Smith reestablished his lead with four straight birdies to start the back nine, giving him a three-shot lead heading into the final hole. Lahiri birdied the 17th behind Smith to cut the lead to two, while on the 18th, Smith hit his ball into the water as it looked like the title might be slipping away. However, he managed to salvage bogey, leaving Lahiri needing a birdie to force a playoff, but the Indian golfer could only manage a par, cementing Smith's victory. The victory meant he became the fifth Australian to win the famous event, moving Smith up to sixth in golf's world rankings. Smith hits out of the pine straw along the 18th fairway during the final round of the Players Championship."I felt as though one of these big ones was the next step for me," Smith said. "I've knocked on the door a few times and I just felt like it was my time.When asked about joining his countrymen in winning the tournament, Smith said: "Obviously, lots of Australians have won here, lots of great Australian golfers have won here, but the best that have ever lived have won here, as well."So it's pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them."

78,,(CNN)The NBA has fined the Brooklyn Nets organization $50,000 for allowing Kyrie Irving into the team's locker room on Sunday.Irving, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, is unable to play in the team's home games due to New York City's workplace vaccine mandate but is allowed to attend home games as a spectator.Irving was in attendance courtside for the team's 110-107 victory over the New York Knicks at Barclays Center in New York on Sunday, and the NBA says the Nets were fined for "violating local New York City law and league health and safety protocols."According the ESPN's Malika Andrews, Irving purchased the courtside seats.In a statement released on Monday, Nets star forward Kevin Durant expressed his appreciation for New York Mayor Eric Adams' efforts after critiquing him and the city's vaccination mandate on Sunday.Read More"The last two years have been a difficult and painful time for New Yorkers, as well as a very confusing time with the changing landscape of the rules and mandates," the statement read.

"Listen. You're right. Kyrie can play tomorrow.

"The nonsensical ordinance that singles out our own New York City players is fundamentally unfair," Tremaglio wrote. "Under this current rule, out-of-town athletes can come into the city and not be vaccinated, and fans can enter both the Barclays Center and MSG regardless of vaccination status."Yet New York City athletes have to be vaccinated to compete in their home arenas. If this rule is about protecting people, it just doesn't make sense and the city of New York needs to end it immediately."With the city mandate still in place, Irving will not be able to play in 10 of the team's final 14 games.

80,,(CNN)When Jonathan Franks first heard that the American basketball star Brittney Griner had been detained in Russia, his initial sense was one of disbelief.But it wasn't any kind of incredulity that she'd been arrested accused of possession of some cannabis oil at an airport near Moscow, more that any western media would relay the details of her alleged crime as if it was fact."This is being reported as if people are taking these allegations seriously," he told CNN.  "I think that it's a huge mistake to report these allegations as if they're true or even are likely to be true."Brittney Griner: Why so many WNBA stars play basketball overseasFranks was immediately suspicious, because he has worked on behalf of numerous American citizens who have unexpectedly found themselves in similar situations with hostile governments. He's currently the campaign spokesman for Trevor Reed, who has been detained in Russia since August 2019.Based on the limited information that has been provided by the Russian Federal Customs Service and state media, Franks is very concerned about the predicament that Griner now finds herself to be in.Read More"This has a lot of hallmarks of a very wrongful and arbitrary detention," he explained. "I found the video from the Russian customs service odd. They're parading her before cameras. The mugshot was completely unnecessary and asinine."Brittney Griner #42 of the Phoenix Mercury during the first half of the WNBA game at the Footprint Center on August 31, 2021 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Russian Customs Service claims that Griner was 'smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances' and says that a criminal case is underway. A potential jail sentence of 10 years has been mentioned."They're making her out to sound like a drug kingpin. I think that it is unlikely that Ms. Griner will get a fair trial," concludes Franks, "because nobody gets a fair trial in Russia. It's a rigged game."  In 2014, the American Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian was detained in Tehran. He couldn't have known it at the time, but he was in for a long stay at Iran's notorious Evin Prison: 544 days.The Washington Post reporter was eventually released in January 2016, and in Griner's case he sees many parallels to his own. "It's the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable," Rezaian told CNN."I know from my own case that the supposed charges against me were not based in anything like reality, and they were used to perpetuate a narrative about why I was being held."Like Franks, Rezaian cautions against repeating the allegations against Griner verbatim."I think that every time reporters repeat that narrative, we're doing some of the dirty work of the hostage takers for them. My attitude is Brittney Griner is innocent of any crimes until the world sees otherwise," adds Rezaian.Brittney Griner #42 of the Phoenix Mercury celebrates with fans following Game Two of the 2021 WNBA Finals at Footprint Center on October 13, 2021 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Mercury defeated the Sky 91-86 in overtime.It's still not exactly clear when Griner was apprehended in Russia, but it was some time in February, as she was returning from the States to compete for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian basketball league.It's Griner's seventh season in Russia, where she plays during the off-season in North America. News of her predicament didn't arrive in the US until March 5, when Russia revealed that they were holding her.Only then did Griner's wife, Cherelle, begin writing about it on Instagram. "There are no words to express this pain," she said. "I'm hurting, we're hurting."If she can indeed be classified as a 'hostage,' Griner will join an unenviable club of around more than 50 American citizens who are currently held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas.Campaigners have been working to free Americans Reed and Paul Whelan, who are both in Russia.Whilst acknowledging that Griner's family have been placed under an enormous amount of emotional stress, Rezaian believes they should have spoken up sooner. "They made the same mistake that I see others making time and again, allowing the possible hostage taker to take control of the narrative," says Rezaian."Unfortunately, we see people telling themselves: 'This is all just a big mistake that's going to blow over in a few days.' Suppressing her detention isn't doing her any favors, these things don't magically resolve themselves."Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States drives to the basket against Team Japan during the first half of the Women's Basketball final game on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. The timing of Griner's detention could hardly be worse, she was arrested in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and it was publicized only after the US had begun sanctioning the Russian government."You can't extricate these things from each other," Rezaian explained. "To try and maintain diplomatic niceties around these situations may be in the interest of US national security, but it's certainly not in the interest of Brittney Griner."Rezaian urges Griner's family to speak up and encourages her American employers to make some noise.Griner is a two-time Olympic champion, a seven-time all-star with the Phoenix Mercury and a legend of the women's professional league, the WNBA. Whilst her team and the league have issued brief statements, Rezaian says they could and should be doing so much more."The WNBA, a part of the NBA, one of the biggest and most powerful sports leagues in the whole world, has a real responsibility to this individual," he says. "There should be a robust response."Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States takes a selfie with her teammates and their gold medals during the Women's Basketball medal ceremony on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. In the vacuum of information about Griner's situation, some have sought to fill the airwaves with commentary about her involvement with Russian basketball and the wisdom of her decision to travel there at a time when geo-political tensions in the region resembled a powder keg.It's a sentiment that smacks of victim-blaming. "It's irrelevant," says Rezaian. "It's not a credible argument."Franks is equally dismissive. "Would have, could have, should have. It's Monday morning quarterbacking, and it's not helpful," he says. "They have welcomed her to that country to work. To me, that's pretty brazen."Both men say that Griner had every right to continue working as a professional athlete in Russia, and the fact that a country in which she was well known and celebrated has now locked her up only makes the allegations against her more suspicious.Rezaian recalls the countless trips he made in and out of Iran over a period of five years. "I never had any problems until I did,| he says. "Is that my fault? No, absolutely not."Colin Allred: US Representative says Brittney Griner case is 'extremely concerning' ​and that her consular access ​has been blocked It's hard for anybody to predict what the coming weeks and months will bring in Griner's case, but Rezaian draws on his own experience to suggest that Griner might have to prepare for a long stay in Russia. "It may turn out to be a marathon, not a sprint. You hope that it's a sprint but conserve your energy in a way that that will benefit you throughout this ordeal," he says.In a podcast called '544 Days,' that he released in October 2021, Rezaian details the anxiety, uncertainty, and monotony of his detention in Iran. He says he made the audio series partly to lay out a roadmap to the families of other citizens that may one day find themselves in a similar situation."I tried to find things to laugh at every day because there's certainly a lot of absurdity in these situations," he adds."That doesn't take away from the horror and the terror of it, but the absurdity that a great American athlete is being held on unsubstantiated charges at the dawn of a cataclysmic war on the other side of the world? It is horrifying, but it's also farcical in its own way."Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States poses for photographs with her gold medal during the Women's Basketball medal ceremony on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. Franks knows from his time of advocating for Reed that Griner could be detained for a while. He urges everybody that cares about her to keep her case in the public arena."Sports fans can play a huge role because they're not a constituency that I think the [American] government is hearing from," says Franks."You want to see Brittney Griner come home? Or Trevor Reed or Paul Whelan or any of the other 50 hostages? I would suggest calling the White House every day and telling them you want President Biden to prioritize the repatriation of wrongfully detained American citizens."Franks reiterates that Griner's family should do the same. "There's a difficult choice to make about whether to speak or not to but shine a light," he says. "If it were my loved one, my answer would be shine a light. Every time."People that do wrongful detention are oddly sensitive to bad headlines."
81,,(CNN)Even by Paris Saint-Germain's standards, the past week has been an eventful one.It started last Wednesday with yet another Champions League capitulation, something PSG has become rather adept at.However, the recent meltdown against Real Madrid -- in which PSG conceded three goals in 27 minutes to throw away a 2-0 aggregate lead -- differed to the previous implosions against Barcelona and Manchester United in one key way: it wasn't particularly surprising.As soon as goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's dawdling had gifted Karim Benzema the first of his three goals, PSG's demise felt inevitable. But despite that inevitability, it still made for gruesome yet compelling viewing, like peaking through your fingers while watching a horror movie.The sequel to that horror show was Saturday's 3-0 win against Bordeaux, in which a significant section of PSG fans turned on their own players. During the match, most of the squad was treated to a frosty reception by the Parc des Princes crowd -- and some received a frostier welcome than others.Read MoreMost notably Neymar and Lionel Messi, both of who were roundly booed by PSG fans during the build up to the opening goal. There was a loud cheer when Neymar turned the ball into the net, but those cheers promptly turned to jeers once the initial jubilation had subsided.READ: Karim Benzema scores hat-trick in 17 minutes as Real Madrid dumps PSG out of Champions LeagueLionel Messi and Neymar were on the receiving end of jeers from their own fans.Messi arrived in Paris to much fanfare in what was arguably the most shocking player move in history, but the signing has so far been painfully underwhelming for PSG fans.The Argentine has mustered a paltry two goals in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this season, with five more coming in the Champions League, and has looked like a shadow of the player he was even in those later years at Barcelona.UEFA investigationThe humiliation against Real Madrid on the pitch was compounded by the widely reported behavior of PSG delegates off it.After the game, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo reportedly confronted the officials in the referees' dressing room to express their anger at Real Madrid's first goal, which they believe came after Benzema had committed a foul on Donnarumma.UEFA later confirmed that a disciplinary case into the incident had been opened. "The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will take a decision in due course," European football's governing body said.PSG declined to comment on the UEFA disciplinary case when contacted by CNN.While the frustration brought on by PSG's Champions League failures were directed at the players on the pitch on Saturday, Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo haven't escaped the ire of the club's supporters.In a statement released earlier on Saturday, club supporter group Collectif Ultra Paris called for Al-Khelaifi's resignation.Lionel Messi has managed just two goals in Ligue 1 all season."How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker?" was one of several questions posed in the statement."We don't have a short memory. We know what our return owes to president Nasser Al-Khelaifi but it is clear he is not the man for the job."The club's current situation requires complete reorganization at all levels going forward and the daily presence of its president."On Monday, fan frustration was visible for all to see at PSG's training center and Parc des Princes stadium, where insults and calls for Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo to leave the club were sprayed onto the facilities."Nasser, Leo out," read one piece of graffiti, thought to be aimed at Leonardo rather than Messi.Likewise, head coach Mauricio Pochettino did not escape from the Real Madrid debacle without any blame. Unsurprisingly, the Argentine has faced calls for his sacking or resignation, but Leonardo insisted that wasn't a solution."We shouldn't throw everything in the bin," he told RMC Sport. "We shouldn't start from scratch after every loss. The objective is to win the Champions League, and until half time we were fine."We have to look to improve this team and maintain morale to play in Ligue 1 and to finish the season well. We should stay together. Pochettino is still part of the project for this season. It's not the time to think about that."Mauricio Pochettino has come in for criticism following the Real Madrid defeat.With 10 games left in Ligue 1 and holding a 15-point lead over second-place Marseille, PSG is almost certain to secure it's seventh French league title in eight season.Following the win over Bordeaux, Pochettino said he was "sad" to hear the booing from the crowd and insisted their anger was also felt within the squad."We were all affected," he said. "We understand the disappointment and the frustration. We're all living it together, as a team. We have a duty to take responsibility for what happened. We share this disappointment with the supporters."Player departures?One player who did manage to escape the booing was Kylian Mbappe.The striker, who was cheered throughout the match against Bordeaux, is the golden boy of French football and scored both of PSG's goals in the recent tie against Real Madrid. Despite the French club boasting both Messi and Neymar in its ranks, Mbappe is perhaps PSG's most prized asset.It will come as a significant concern, then, that there is the strong possibility of PSG losing Mbappe for free in the summer. The 23-year-old's current contract expires on June 30, 2022 and so far no headway has been made on a new deal.Mbappe told CNN at the end of December, just ahead of European football's January transfer window, that he would "100%" finish the season with PSG. However, he hasn't hidden his desire to move to pastures new -- specifically pastures in Madrid.When Real submitted a $188 million bid for Mbappe in August -- a deal that was close to being agreed -- the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG."I was honest," Mbappe said. "I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart. I'm happy to stay ... it's my city too. I'm French ... I want to win everything this season."Whether Mbappe is still "happy to stay" now, however, is another matter, and one that is sure to give Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo yet another headache.

Alonso told reporters Monday he was driving his pickup to Mets camp in Port St. Lucie when he was hit by another driver who ran a red light. Alonso, who set the major league home run record for rookies in 2019, said he was uninjured after his Ford pickup truck flipped over "probably three times.""This is a really special spring training because yesterday was a really close experience to death," Alonso said. "I'm just really thankful to be alive."I was coming here to work, coming to spring training, and the next thing I know I'm kicking my windshield in trying to get out of a flipped-over car," he said.Alonso said his wife, Haley, was following him in another vehicle when the crash happened.

83,,(CNN)If you watch Shane Lowry play golf, he's sure to eventually make you get out of your seat. Known for being one of the most entertaining names in golf, the Irishman caused the Players Championship to erupt on Sunday, hitting a hole-in-one on the famous 17th. During the third round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events, Lowry achieved the feat at the par-three, 124-yard island hole, which he described afterwards as "one of the most iconic holes in golf."The 34-year-old hit a pitching wedge with the ball landing approximately 10 feet past the hole before it gradually rolled towards the pin and dropped in, sparking wild scenes of celebration. He embraced his playing partner and Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter as the crowd went wild. Read MoreAfter picking the ball out of the hole, Lowry threw the ball into the crowd and later signed it.  "It was a special thing to happen, and I'm looking forward to turning on my phone and seeing the messages I've got," Lowry explained. "Not only that, it put me back in the tournament somewhat. So it was amazing. It's been a long day today, and I'm glad to make the call and finish well today. Played the 17 hole twice and did it in three shots, so it doesn't owe me anything."I'm excited for tomorrow now. If it's a long day tomorrow, I can do something hopefully in the morning and finish it off in the afternoon."It's the 10th hole-in-one on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass, and the first since Ryan Moore achieved the feat at the 2019 edition of the Players Championship. It is Lowry's second hole-in-one on the PGA Tour, his first coming at the 2016 Masters. Lowry plays his shot from the 10th tee during the third round of the Players Championship.Lowry is now four-under for the tournament, four off the top of the leaderboard. This year's Players Championship has had severe delays after inclement weather swept into the area in Florida. Because of high winds, raining and electric storms, when play resumes on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field will still have to complete their third rounds. India's Anirban Lahiri leads on nine under.
84,,(CNN)For almost 20 years, Roman Abramovich rocketed Chelsea from a club on the periphery of the elite to a global football superpower, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in his reign coming to an abrupt end.Bloody conflict in Ukraine and international outrage over Russia's invasion placed a renewed focus on Abramovich and his ownership of Chelsea. It's a focus that has shone a light on the jarring friction between sport and politics: Abramovich the dream-realizing football owner -- adored by much of the Chelsea fanbase -- versus Abramovich the Russian oligarch.Days after the war began, as the West responded by imposing sanctions on Russia and its oligarchs, Abramovich's assets -- including Chelsea -- appeared increasingly vulnerable to a more punitive financial environment and he soon announced his plans to sell the club.Before the sale could be completed, however, the UK government announced that Abramovich would be subject to sanctions as one of "Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin."Read MoreChelsea FC: British property developer Nick Candy "still interested in" buying club despite Roman Abramovich sanctionsOn Saturday, the English Premier League's board disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea.The disqualification of an owner would normally trigger the sale of their shareholding, though in the case of Abramovich the Russian oligrach had already announced his intention to sell the club and that process is underway.The UK government is open to Chelsea's sale and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale to take place, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday.Chelsea will be somewhat shielded from the sanctions, allowed to continue fulfilling its fixtures under a special license. But it does mean the club is not able to sell merchandise or tickets to upcoming games, engage in the transfer market, or issue new contracts to players.Last month British lawmaker Chris Bryant called for Abramovich to lose ownership of Chelsea after seeing a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns the 55-year-old had "links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices," the MP said in Parliament.According to Reuters, Abramovich has been granted Portuguese and Israeli citizenship in recent years.  "Surely, Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country?" Bryant said.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the oligarch being sanctioned.Spurred by Abramovich's enormous financial investment -- upwards of $1.99 billion according to respected football business blogger Swiss Ramble -- Chelsea has enjoyed an unprecedented period of success since his $233 million acquisition of the club in June 2003."I don't want to throw my money away," Abramovich told the BBC following the takeover, "but it's really about having fun and that means success and trophies."During the 19 years under Abramovich, the club has collected 21 major trophies, according to Chelsea. After winning the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi last month, Chelsea has officially won ever major trophy at the club's disposal.JUST WATCHEDHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club ownerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club owner 02:56'Thank you Mr Abramovich'It is gratitude for this golden era that underpinned a sweeping tide of adulation for the oligarch upon the announcement of his impending sale of the club, among fans as well as former players."The best," former captain John Terry tweeted, accompanied by a picture of him and Abramovich celebrating another Premier League triumph in 2017.A statement from the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) board encapsulated the broader outpouring of feeling among the club's fans on social media, thanking Abramovich for "his affection, passion and dedication" during a tenure that brought "unparalleled success.""Chelsea supporters will never forget all he has done for our club. Thank you Mr Abramovich," the statement added, published before the UK government announced the sanctions.According to Richard Weekes, who is one of the founders of Chelsea supporters' group 'We Are The Shed,' "the Roman Empire" helped realize supporters' wildest dreams."The last 20 years has enabled Chelsea supporters to live their best lives," Weekes told CNN before Abramovich would be sanctioned."Traveling around the world winning and celebrating the biggest prizes in football, you simply cannot ask for more than that and, for that reason, Roman will forever have a place in all Chelsea supporters' hearts."To have 'the Roman Empire' come to an end with Chelsea as 'Champions of the World' could not be a more fitting conclusion to this chapter in our history."'Scorched air'If the last 19 years have been jam-packed with golden memories and trophy after trophy, the coming days and months look more uncertain.In light of the sanctions placed on Abramovich and the consequential impact on Chelsea, the club released a statement confirming it would seek "permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible."Amid such turmoil, the CST called for the voices of supporters to be heard."Supporters MUST be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fanbase," the group said in a statement on Twitter. "The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea's future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club."Chelsea beat Norwich 3-1 in its latest English Premier League match on March 10. The sanctions also prevent a sale of the club, pending the issuance of a special license.In his initial statement published on the club's website before he was sanctioned, Abramovich said the net proceeds from the sale will be donated to a foundation set up "for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine."  That statement was conspicuously vague regarding who specifically might be a victim; Abramovich's critics pointed out that the wording could also allow his new foundation to support the families of Russian soldiers.  "Roman Abramovich is very sensitive to what is happening now," Mikhail Khordokovsky, an exiled oligarch and Putin critic, told CNN before the recent sanctions were announced. "I don't have any information, but I can't imagine that he's made any decision without first consulting with Putin."Regardless, this means that he's gotten a whiff of scorched air. What he smells is the fire burning under President Putin," Khodorkovsky said, referring to Abramovich's plans to sell Chelsea.What CAN the club do?Pay allowances and pensions of all employees of the Club, including the wages of Players and coaching staff.Pay reasonable costs of travel to and from Fixtures but "not exceeding the value of £20,000 per game per Club team."Pay reasonable costs necessary for the purposes of the Club hosting Fixtures at its home grounds but "not exceeding the value of £500,000 per Fixture per Club Team."Pay fees, dividends or other allowances to directors of the Club.Pay "reasonable fees" or other costs directly related to ongoing regular maintenance of the Club.Broadcasters may broadcast any Fixtures involving the Club.In 2018 the US Treasury released the names of 210 prominent Russians, dubbed the "Putin list."The administration was required to name the companies and individuals and consider whether to sanction them under legislation meant to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 US election, as well as its human rights violations, annexation of Crimea, and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.The list, which included  Abramovich, reads like the US has "simply rewritten the Kremlin's phone book," said Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev in a Facebook post at the time.But if Abramovich's current wealth and apparent safety in Russia reflect an affinity with Putin, that may have been what put him at risk with the UK government. Vladimir Putin: The world of sport has shunned the Russian president. So what?"He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich," the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. Canada have since sanctioned Abramovich too.Abramovich made his fortune in steel and investments, taking advantage of the mass privatization that characterized Boris Yeltsin's premiership following the fall of the Soviet Union.Abramovich's wealth, valued at $14.5 billion in 2022 by Forbes, led to influence within Russian political circles as he was first elected to the State Duma and then appointed governor of Chukotka from 2000 to 2008.A nervous futureWhile Weekes admitted that the incoming owner's status as an oligarch had played on his mind back in 2003, he added that fans would have had little power to reverse the takeover regardless of their feelings."Chelsea fans did not choose to be bought," Weekes said, "it is unlikely any pushback would have changed the decision at the time had we stopped to think about the morality behind it."Today people are more prepared to look into things a little deeper, to understand right from wrong and, with regards to a football club, have the desire to know that who is representing their team suits their ideologies and beliefs. This is a good thing."Only time will tell if our feeling towards his character will change but, for now, there is no denying the happiness he brought to Chelsea supporters during his time here and for that we are thankful."What CAN'T the club do?Enter into transfer deals for new players or receive money for selling existing players.Issue new contracts to existing players.Sell any new tickets to upcoming games -- only season ticket holders can go to games for the foreseeable future.Sell any merchandise -- however, any third parties who purchased or produced Club Merchandise prior to Thursday are permitted to sell stock.This schism between appreciation and criticism manifested itself in Chelsea's league fixtures at Burnley on March 5 and at Norwich City on March 10.As a minute's applause was held in tribute to Ukraine before the Burnley game, chants of Abramovich's name could be heard on a Sky Sports broadcast before being drowned out by boos from the stands.The chants drew reproach from Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel after the game."If we show solidarity, we show solidarity and we should do it together. We take the knee together, if an important person from other clubs or from our club unfortunately dies, we show a minute of respect," Tuchel told reporters after the game, which Chelsea won 4-0. "It's not the moment to give other messages, it's a moment to show respect. We do this because this is what we are also as a club, we show respect as a club. We need our fans to commit to this minute of applause in the moment. "We do it for Ukraine, there is no second opinion about the situation there. They have our thoughts and our support, and we should stand together as a club."Players, officials and fans took part in a minute of applause to indicate peace and sympathy with Ukraine before Burnley faced Chelsea.Beyond this mixture of sentiment among fans is an equally strong feeling of anxiety. Rumors of potential buyers continue to abound, but as yet it remains to be seen when the club's future will be clarified.Who will the new owner be? Will they be capable or willing to invest the same funds as Abramovich? Would they try to move Chelsea away from Stamford Bridge? After almost two decades of looking ahead to nothing but success, these questions and more have Weekes' mind "whirling.""In the end Roman explicitly outlined that owning Chelsea was never for financial gain, will the new owner fell that way? Unlikely," Weekes said."That is worrying, as, on top of everything, it might be the supporters that end up paying the price."
85,,(CNN)As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, the grim reality of war has taken center stage, with more than two million Ukrainians fleeing the country and hundreds dead, according to the UN.Russia is already paying a price for its aggression -- countries around the world are imposing sanctions and the Russian ruble has plunged even further against the dollar, hitting record lows.A plethora of international sports organizations and governing bodies have also responded to the invasion targeting Russia and its athletes with sanctions of varying severity, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been stripped of multiple honorary sporting titles.Notably Russian and Belarusian athletes were not allowed to compete at the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing after multiple other countries' athletes and teams threatened not to compete at the Games, according to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended a ban for Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in international competition."The situation is monstrous, of course. This is a disgrace for the International Paralympic Committee," said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters following the decision.Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbolRead MoreThe IOC also announced that it had withdrawn the Olympic Order -- the highest award of the Olympic movement -- from Putin."The IOC was viewed as having a close relationship with Russia," Michael Payne, former head of marketing at the IOC, told CNN. "The fact that the IOC has now issued a set of sanctions to Russia, which, in my view, are probably the strongest sanctions the IOC has ever issued ... since probably the early 60s when the IOC banned South Africa for its apartheid regime," he said.Meanwhile, world football's governing body, FIFA, and European soccer body, UEFA, have suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions "until further notice."Vladimir Putin kicks a football during an event in the Red Square on June 28, 2018 in Moscow."Vladimir Putin has been passionate about both sports and using sport to project Russia's importance on the world stage and giving back to the Russian people a sense of pride in their success on the world stage."Payne added that the most immediate impact of sanctions could be to challenge the Kremlin's narrative on the conflict, with ordinary Russians wondering what has happened to events they were due to host.UEFA announced last month that this year's Champions League final will no longer take place in St. Petersburg's Krestovsky Stadium, which is sponsored by Russian state-owned company Gazprom, and will now be moved to the Stade de France in Paris to be played on the original date of May 28."There can be no misunderstanding: no amount of control of the Russian media is able to explain what's going on in the sports world, that they've suddenly been banished," Payne said.Russia is covering the country's invasion of Ukraine very differently to CNN and other western news outlets. A new law forbids media operating in Russia to use the words "war," "attack" or "invasion" to describe Putin's decision to unleash his forces against Ukraine. Instead, they are to use the Kremlin's Orwellian phrase: "special military operation."Russians' access to social media like Facebook and Twitter has also been severely restricted."Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can't they see their Russian athletes performing? And clearly, then there's prompting the Russian people to say 'What's going on?'" Payne said.​"Will Putin care about having to give his Olympic gold order back or what the rest of the international world thinks of him? Probably not. "Will he care about what all the local Russians are saying, 'Hang on, what is going on?' Absolutely." Sports as a nationalist toolLukas Aubin, associate researcher at The French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and a specialist in the geopolitics of Russia and sports, told CNN Sport that Putin carefully curates his image so that observers are aware of his sporting prowess, on a national and international level."When Putin arrived at power in 2000, one of his first decisions was to invite his former coach in judo [to the Kremlin]," he said.The Russian premier has also been pictured ice swimming, fishing and bare-chested horseback riding.Putin attends a gala match of the Night Hockey League teams at the Bolshoy ice arena on May 10, 2017 in Sochi, Russia. "Today, President Putin uses sports as an element of his power. And not only as a part of his personality because he also has created a big sporting system. He's using oligarchs, politics, former athletes, to create a machine."It's a big system, where people [are] driven by Putin in the directions that they need to create a beautiful picture of Russia, in the world of sports," he added.This worked for the most part, Aubin said."It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics. Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup. It is really very hard to say how many international sporting events Russia [has] hosted the past 10 years -- it's really a lot. At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power," Aubin added.  Vera Tolz, professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, told CNN Sport that Putin has used Russian nationalism "instrumentally and very systematically" as a way of legitimizing his regime since he came to power.Winter Paralympics: Ukrainian athletes' thoughts are with those fighting the invasion back home as they enjoy golden success in Beijing"Nationalism -- and the kind of national unification with promoting particular versions of history, of organizing, establishing new national holidays, and of course, sport -- has been absolutely key to his legitimation strategy," she explained, adding such tactics date back to the Soviet period, where sport was used "very intensively as a tool of building loyalty of the people to the regime.""Even the fact that the Kremlin, Russia, has gone to such lengths, in using doping, in order to win more medals, in a way shows how participating in competitions and winning, winning was key to Putin's Popular Mobilization strategy," Tolz added. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions -- notably the Olympics and the World Cup -- for four years over doping non-compliance. The ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.WADA's punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network."Every time you let Russia into an international sporting event, you're essentially agreeing to swim with man-eating sharks. They will cheat your athletes, they will not feel bad about it, they will lie about it, if they're caught, they will blame you for calling it out," Jim Walden, the US lawyer of Grigory Rodchenkov who was instrumental in exposing Russia's initial cover-up, told CNN.Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Putin spoke of his frustration of the "politicization of sport" and that the "the rights and interests of our athletes must be protected from any arbitrariness."The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.Putin looks on during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on February 4. Commissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition."Putin very much uses his control over sport to try to game the world and win as much as possible, and also curates the content for the Russian population so that he can get maximum popularity, which translates into maximum power to do what he wants internationally -- essentially pitting Russia against the rest of the world, at least the rest of the Western world," Walden added.Fast forward to 2022 and another doping scandal -- surrounding Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva -- overshadowed the Winter Olympics in Beijing.The 15-year-old Valieva, a breakout star of the Games who got the highest mark in the figure skating team event, was allowed to compete despite testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina. The failed test occurred before the Winter Olympics but only came to light during the Games, and it remains unclear if the drug test controversy will see the medal revoked."Not only is Russia myopically focused on winning at any cost, but in terms of any costs, it's no holds barred, right? So murder, bribery, drug trafficking, any kind of criminality that will give them an advantage. They believe that not only will they do it, but that other people are weak for following the rules," Walden said."So they marry criminality with obstruction and put that together with sports. And that is how they have consistently won. And that's how the Russian government has used it to prop up its own popularity, so that it has more leeway to engage in troublemaking abroad," he added.Trail of moneyOlympic great Edwin Moses, who opposed the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics, has gone so far as to call for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Olympics."The boycott in 1980 was political. This is just horrible," Moses, who is Chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, said in a press release from Laureus last week."It hasn't got a lot to do with politics, it has to do with humanity, the war, the fighting, the children and innocent people getting killed, rockets and missiles, tanks ... and it's live on TV, so everyone is aware of it."I was in favor of banning the Russians because of what happened in Sochi in 2014 for really corrupting the integrity of the Olympic Games, via doping. I was on the executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and I thought the penalties were too light."What they're doing to the entire world right now in Ukraine, is exactly the same thing they've done to sport, in my opinion. Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games]."A few years ago, Moses says he met Putin."I once sat next to him at [a] table. Two seats to my left, and the translator was in between. And I spoke to him that entire evening. I know how he talked about sports, like it was the Holy Grail, and how important sport was, and how it was good where the best of everyone's country, regardless of your philosophy can compete together, and whoever wins, wins.... I realize now, it was just propaganda."CNN's Ben Morse and Ben Church contributed reporting.
86,,(CNN)Ukrainian boxers Oleksandr Usyk and Vasiliy Lomachenko are childhood friends. They grew up dreaming of fighting their way to fame and glory, and together they conquered the world with their fists.Between them, the 35-year-old Usyk and the 34-year-old Lomachenko won three Olympic gold medals and have since established themselves among the elite boxers in the world. But now they are facing a very different fight -- an existential one -- for the very future of their country. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Usyk and Lomachenko have traveled into Ukraine, taken up arms and joined the territorial defense battalion.Speaking via a video link from a basement in Kyiv, Usyk exclusively told CNN that it's not just invading forces he needs to look out for, but looters as well. He says that he's prepared to take a life, if necessary."If they will want to take my life, or the lives of my close ones, I will have to do it," he said. "But I don't want that. I don't want to shoot, I don't want to kill anybody, but if they will be killing me, I will have no choice."Read MoreUsyk's manager, Egis Klimas, helped coordinate the interview and translated for Usyk, who doesn't speak English. Despite the terrifying situation that many Ukrainians now find themselves in, Usyk says that he isn't afraid."Maybe, it'll sound sentimental," he explained, "but my soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor belong to my country, to my family. So there is no fear, absolutely no fear. There's just bafflement -- how could this be in the 21st century?"He's not in Ukraine to box right now, but the noble art is still useful in this moment. "It has helped me to be calm and mentally prepared," he said, "And it helps me to help others who are panicking and nervous." Oleksandr Usyk tells CNN that his "country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt."Both men were outside of the country when Russia invaded; Usyk had been in London, shooting sequences for an upcoming video game.He was intending to fly home just hours after the hostilities had commenced, but with the airports closed, he instead flew to Warsaw in Poland and drove almost 500 miles back home and over the border to Kyiv.Lomachenko had been visiting a monastery in Greece and returned home the next day. Instead of flying directly to his hometown of Odessa, he traveled to Bucharest in Romania, then drove for nine hours to the port and caught a ferry into Ukraine.Their manager told CNN that he didn't know they were thinking of taking up arms until they had already signed up for the defense battalion. Former world boxing champions, Vitali -- who is also the Mayor of Kyiv -- and Wladimir Klitschko, have also taken up arms in defense of their nation.Elina Svitolina: Worried for her parents, Ukrainian tennis star says she has been suffering sleepless nights'The bombing around is crazy'Lomachenko was scheduled to speak with CNN at the same time as Usyk but wasn't responding to the calls from his manager at the time. Early Wednesday morning local time, Klimas confirmed to CNN that Lomachenko was safe and sound.He and Usyk remain close: they are godfathers to each other's children and celebrate family birthdays together. Six days into the war, Usyk knows that nowhere is safe anymore in Ukraine."The bombing around is crazy," Usyk said. "They just bombed the city of Mariupol, one of my friends got a rocket in his roof. [The Russians] are not playing games." As the fighting rages, so too does the debate about whether Russian athletes should be sanctioned for the actions of their country. Usyk chose not to weigh in directly, suggesting that there are innocent people on both sides of the conflict."Russian people don't really know exactly what's going on here. They're not seeing what's going on. They are victims of their President [Vladimir Putin]."Usyk won his heavyweight title belts in a superb display in September 2021 against former champion Anthony Joshua.Usyk has only just become the IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO world heavyweight champion. In September, he defeated Anthony Joshua in London in a superb boxing display to claim the belts. His manager says that talks of a rematch this summer are at an advanced stage.The lightweight Lomachenko has previously been world champion in three different weight classes and was planning to fight George Kambosos in Australia in June.But understandably, boxing is the last thing on their minds."I really don't know when I'm going to be stepping back in the ring," said Usyk, who looked exhausted and emotional in his interview with CNN. "My country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt."Usyk has three children and, during the interview, the sound of young voices could be heard playing behind him in the basement. He says that family, friends and neighbors have been sheltering together. "When there is an air raid alarm, we hide. Of course, it's fun when there are a lot of us here -- we're having fun. But we're forcing ourselves to have fun." They're trying to keep the mood light for the kids.But in a separate conversation with CNN, Usyk's manager Klimas emphasized the gravity of the situation: "They're in big danger. When the bullets start flying, the bullet doesn't care if you're a world champion. The bullet just goes through."

88,,(CNN)Whether it was his bleach blonde hair or his devastating spin bowling which had batters quivering and quaking, Shane Warne did things his own way. The Australian cricket great died at the age of 52 from a suspected heart attack on Friday, according to a statement from his management team. Warne took over 1,000 international wickets, including 708 Test wickets -- second only to Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan -- during his illustrious career and retired from cricket in 2013 as one of the greatest to ever play the sport. He was a leading figure of the dominant Australian side of the late 1990s and early 2000s, winning multiple Ashes series and the World Cup in 1999. Allied to his dominance with the ball was his charismatic personality, which transformed Warne from cricket star to global sporting superstar. Read More"Warnie was an all time great, a once in a century type cricketer, and his records will live on forever," said current Australia captain Pat Cummins, dubbing Warne "King" in his statement.  "We all grew up watching Warnie, idolising him, we all had posters on his wall, had his earrings. What we loved so much about Warnie was his showmanship, his charisma, his tactics, the way he willed himself and the team around him to will teams around him to win games for Australia, and above all else his incredible skills as a leg-spinner."There's so many guys in this team and squad who still hold him as a hero ... all-time favorite player. The game was never the same after Warnie emerged and the game will never be the same after his passing."Rest in peace, King."Warne celebrates with his teammates after taking the wicket Sachin Tendulkar in 1999.Ball of the centuryWarne wasn't just a bowler capable of dominating matches almost single handedly, he was also an entertainer, happy to engage in banter with England fans and often the subject of tabloid headlines.If his first year as an international player gave a few indications that he was destined for success, a single ball he bowled in Manchester in 1993 completely changed perceptions about the bowler.Just a year after making his international debut in 1992, Warne was playing in his first Ashes series in England. Adorned with his short, bright blonde hair and wielding his now famous right-arm bowling action, Warne produced a bamboozling delivery in what has been dubbed the "ball of the century."The delivery looked to be heading past England batter Mike Gatting's leg stump. Then it bounced on the pitch, spun dramatically and missed Gatting's bat before astonishingly hitting the off-stump. Like many others, Gatting looked astounded that such an initially harmless-looking delivery had cost him his wicket --  former England player Graham Gooch said: "He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch."Warne bowling during the Third Ashes test match against England at Old Trafford cricket ground on July 4, 1997.Warne's ability to flight and spin the ball to such devastating effect helped revive leg-spin from a forgotten art into a key component in modern day cricket. "The highlight of my cricketing career was to keep wicket to Warnie," Adam Gilchrist, Australia's legendary wicketkeeper and Warne's longtime teammate, wrote on Twitter."Best seat in the house to watch the maestro at work. Have often felt a tad selfish, that Heals and I pretty much exclusively are the only ones who had that thrill and pleasure at Test level. Rip Warnie.Other cricket greats were quick to pay tribute to Warne's remarkable talent."Shocked, stunned & miserable," wrote Indian Sachin Tendulkar -- widely considered one of the best batters of all time."There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels & off field banter. You always had a special place for India & Indians had a special place for you. "Gone too young!"Former India international batter Virender Sehwag said on Twitter: "One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more."Life is very fragile, but this is very difficult to fathom. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans all around the world."'I am shocked to the core'During his career which spanned over 20 years, Warne won numerous trophies and accolades.In Australia's victorious World Cup team in 1999, Warne collected the man of the match award in the final. He was named one of Wisden's five best players of the 20th century, as well as being selected in an all-time Test World XI by Wisden to commemorate 150 years of the cricketers' almanack. Away from international cricket, Warne also played a pivotal role in making the Indian Premier League (IPL) the behemoth it is today. In 2008, he led the Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title, something he believes gave the tournament "credibility because the underdog came good." "To then go and win it in the style we did, that put the IPL on the map. Any underdog story like that -- you look at Leicester City, what they did. It's a pretty amazing story," Warne told CNN in 2019, referring to the soccer underdog's remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2016."I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super successful. We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results."To be part of all of that with the Aussies and do those things was great but the IPL, it was completely different."Warne poses for photos after speaking to the media during a Melbourne Stars Twenty20 Big Bash League announcement on November 8, 2011.Warne played his entire domestic cricket career in Australia with his native Victoria, but had stints with Hampshire in England. "Absolutely shocked and gutted to hear about Shane Warne, wrote former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara. "Legend and friend. Just can't believe it."Former West Indies batter Vivian Richards also said on Twitter: "Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This can't be true... Rest In Peace, Shane Warne. There are no words to describe what I feel right now. A huge loss for cricket."
89,,(CNN)Widely considered to be the GOAT of women's tennis, 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams says she's still aiming to beat Margaret Court's record of 24."I should have been at like 30 or 32 (grand slam singles titles)," Williams told CNN's Christiane Amanpour."I should have had it (the record), really, I've had many opportunities to have it. But I'm not giving up."Williams was forced to miss January's Australian Open following the advice of her medical team, announcing in December that she wasn't "where I need to be physically to compete."Speaking to Amanpour in Paris, Williams said she will play at the French Open in May -- the next grand slam in the tennis calendar -- if her body allows.Read More"Paris is one of my favorite cities, and I actually love the clay. So we'll see what happens. Hopefully if my body is holding up, then I'll definitely be there."Williams in action at the 2021 French Open.Changing the narrativeWilliams' rise from a young girl learning to play tennis on dilapidated courts in Compton, California, to become one of the most successful and decorated athletes in history is the stuff of legend.Now immortalized in the Hollywood film "King Richard" -- which Williams and her sister Venus executive produced -- their father was pivotal in the duo's development as players.Played by Will Smith, the film shows how Richard Williams catapulted his daughters to tennis stardom.Serena Williams hugs her father, Richard, after winning Wimbledon in 2012.Often portrayed as a divisive and eccentric character, Williams told CNN how the sisters aimed to change the narrative around their dad."Unfortunately, entering a new sport where it's predominantly, you know, White and having my dad have like this villain character, when it just wasn't true, just having to deal with that my entire career, from day one to the very end, was just really important for us just to tell the truth," she said.JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams is investing in diversity ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams is investing in diversity  03:28"You know, in order to be an athlete, especially in a single sport, it takes a lot of work, and it takes a lot of dedication. And I look at my daughter and I say, 'Wow, I don't think I could do what my dad did every single day.' It's a lot of work."Serena's older sister Venus paved the way, turning professional one year earlier than her, winning seven grand slam singles titles so far in her career. Venus still competes on the tour, aged 41.Initially, Serena lived in Venus' shadow."My sister was much better than me. I was not very good growing up. And so, everyone was focused on Venus. And in the film, it goes into that, how when we had an opportunity to have better coaches, they saw that Venus was the one."And so, that was devastating for me ... but helpful. Because if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have had the career that I have because I felt like I just had to prove and just had to win."Serena and Venus attend the premiere of Warner Bros' "King Richard" in Hollywood in November 2021.Williams turned to her mother, Oracene Price, who played a critical but often overlooked role in her success."I just had to work with mom. I didn't get to work with the prestigious coaches or anything. And my mom made me tough mentally," she added.'We had to be better'Serena, Venus and their dad came up against racism throughout their careers, most notably in 2001 at Indian Wells.Asked by Amanpour how they perceived and overcame the racism that they experienced as tennis players in a predominantly White sport, Williams responded: "We changed it from being two great Black champions to being the best ever, period. And that's what we did. We took out color, and we just became the best."And yes, we had to play harder, and we had to be better, but it made us better."And at the end of the day, every time we faced a challenge and every time we overcame that challenge, we created Venus and Serena."Williams also discussed her venture fund Serena Ventures, which this week announced $111 million had been raised to invest in founders of diverse backgrounds."It's really about diversity," Williams told Amanpour, explaining that she was spurred to action when she learnt that less than 2% of all venture capital money went to women."Because of tennis, I have a way to impact VC in a different way and bringing diversity to that as well," she said.Venus (L) defeated sister Serena in an all-Williams 2008 Wimbledon final.Double standardsAt times, Williams has shown anger and exasperation with umpires on the court, most infamously at the 2018 US Open final which she lost to Naomi Osaka.She was heavily criticized and fined over the episode.Amanpour asked Williams if she feels double standards exist in the sport, given men routinely act out at umpires, often with impunity.Williams argues with umpire Carlos Ramos during her US Open final match against Osaka in 2018.Responding to a recent incident involving German player Alexander Zverev, in which he struck the umpire's chair multiple times with his racket and was subsequently withdrawn from the Mexican Open and fined, Williams said: "There is absolutely a double standard. I would probably be in jail if I did that. Like literally, no joke."And as she chases Court's grand slam record, Williams is also aware that her career and life won't only be defined by how many titles she might win."I am who I am, I love who I am -- I love the impact that I've had on people, that I continue to have on people," said Williams, who Amanpour interviewed on February 28, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine."Right now the world in such turmoil ... when you look at what's happening in Ukraine and Russia, it's just sad to see," added Williams."Human life ... is so valuable, and it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, it should be amazing and of value."
90,,(CNN)Harold Varner III's rise through golf has been a steady one. As he himself documented on his Instagram, Varner was ranked 1,510th in the world in 2014.Since then, the American has seen a steady improvement year by year, rising through the ranks. But it took a moment of magic that he will never forget to finally crack the top 50 in the world. At the Saudi International earlier in February, Varner sunk a huge 92-foot eagle putt from off the green to snatch victory from friend Bubba Watson. Read MoreVarner celebrates after sinking an eagle putt on the 18th to win the Saudi International.Varner admitted to CNN afterwards that while "everyone else thought it was going in," he "wasn't sure." That dramatic victory catapulted him to 45th in the world rankings and will be a moment he will "talk about it for the rest of my life," Varner said. "I still can't believe it went in," Varner told CNN's Sean Coppack. "I knew I had a chance and that's what you want. When asked where it ranks in his professional career so far, Varner said: "It's No. 1 right now."He also recognized that his spot in the top 50 golf players in the world will open doors for him."I was wanting (to be in the top 50). That is awesome," he said in a press conference. "That's the goal, man. That gets you in the things that I haven't played in. I've played in some big events here and there, but yeah, that's why we play."I was on the cusp of it after Hilton Head and didn't execute, played a lot of golf. Frickin' A. That's all I wanted to know when I was sitting out there."Varner on the 18th green at the Saudi International.'Life happened'Not only did he shoot up golf's rankings, Varner also traveled back to the Charlotte, US, having won approximately $1 million.Since his first professional win in 2016 at the Australian PGA Championship, Varner had undergone somewhat of a barren spell. Between December 2016 and February 2022, Varner didn't win a professional golf tournament. But his belief never wavered during that time. "I've never questioned my ability," he said. "The only people that question it are the people that sit right in here, and they're like, 'Man, he needs to be winning.' But I don't march to anyone's beat in here. I do what I'm supposed to do and things come."Life happened. My wife, my girlfriend at the time, her brother died a week after that and we were celebrating. Things that I wasn't ready to be a man about. I can sit here and tell you like I just didn't know how to handle it because, I don't know, I think it's a hard thing to deal with. Those things get in the way of just focusing on golf."When you're a kid and there's nothing else to do, it's only golf. No, I wouldn't change a thing. How cool is that?

During that time, Varner explained that he's grown a lot as both a player and a man.When asked in his press conference after his victory in Saudi Arabia whether he has become more of a spokesperson for Harold Varner than for different things, he replied: "Amen to that.""I am learning that. I think it comes with maturity. I think just learning how to articulate how to say, 'No,' like I've been struggling saying no to these little kids every time I walk around here today, and it's going to be okay, but I'm going to get them when I leave."
91,,(CNN)You should never meet your idols, so the adage goes. But what if fate not only brings you together, but also places you in direct competition on one of the world's biggest sporting stages?That was the destiny of tennis sensation Cori "Coco" Gauff in 2019 when, as the youngest ever qualifier at Wimbledon, she found herself facing the legendary Venus Williams."I just remember walking out on the court blasting music with my head held down because I didn't want to look at the crowd," Gauff told CNN's Becky Anderson in Dubai. "It was such a long walk from the locker room. It was, like, 15 minutes," she recalls. "Then they have all the walls of the champions, and obviously, I saw Venus there so many times. I was like, 'Oh my gosh, she's lifted this trophy so many times. And here I am like, about to go on against her.'"What happened next was the stuff of fantasy, as the teenager swept her veteran rival aside in straight sets. Stone-faced, almost disbelieving, Gauff walked slowly towards a beaming Williams, who congratulated her warmly from across the net as the crowd erupted in wild applause.Cori "Coco" Gauff greets Venus Williams at the net after winning their women's singles match at Wimbledon 2019.Read MoreElegant dominanceAlmost three years on, Gauff still finds inspiration from Venus and her sister Serena. "I'm inspired by both of them," she says. "And I would say, I don't know, I just think not only their games, but how they handled themselves off the court is something that I look up to."Gauff also acknowledges the importance of having two Black role models in a sport that has traditionally lacked diversity. "For me, there's not much representation of people that look like me in this sport; so, for me as a young girl, just seeing them dominate and do it so elegantly, kind of just inspired me."Serena Williams Fast FactsVenus has also become something of a Coco Gauff fan, too. "I've gotten to have conversations with them, like Venus, I got to play doubles with [her]. That was just something I never thought of happening. And she's always rooting for me. "I remember her posting Instagram stories saying, people ask her questions like, 'Who she's rooting for?' and she would say, 'Serena,' and then she will say, also me, and I thought that's just really cool because I never thought that would happen. "I mean, as a kid, I never thought I'd play either of them, let alone play doubles with one of them!"Gauff plays a backhand in her first round singles match of the Australian Open in January 2022.Role modelAlthough she will only turn 18 in March, Gauff is already treading her own path as a role model for others. She spoke out during the protests following the murder of George Floyd and believes in using her position to inspire change.  "For me, I just feel like it's not so much of responsibility, I feel like that's just me, and that's like my identity," she told Anderson."I want to stand up for people who look like me and feel like they don't have a voice. And I'm lucky enough that some people in the world care about what I have to say. So I try to make sure that I say it and say in a correct way, or in a way that people understand."  She says she is mindful of setting an example to her two younger brothers. "I would say I just kind of try to hold myself to what I want my brothers to be, [and be] a role model for my brothers."'Your mindset can change everything in your life'The Atlanta-born star also draws her own inspiration from closer to home. Her grandmother survived cancer, and Gauff says watching that battle, and the positive mindset with which her grandmother approached it, was a learning experience. "I think your mind kind of controls everything. Your mind controls, you know, how your body feels and how your mood is," she explains.  "One of the things I learned growing up, my grandmother she had lung cancer when I was younger, and now she's cancer free, but I just remember her never being too negative about it, and her always being positive."Gauff and Anderson on court for a friendly match.That attitude made a lasting impression on the youngster and her views on mental health. "I remembered my grandmother telling me that the only reason she thinks she conquered it -- because she had stage four and the chances weren't looking good -- was that she would just wake up every day so mentally in a positive and happy light. "You know, as a kid, I didn't really understand what was going on. But I remember just never seeing her sad or upset or saying, 'Why me?' Instead, she was saying, like, 'Why not me?' So I think for me, now at this age, that showed me that your mindset can change everything in your life. So, if you're not good mentally, you know, it could be as painful."Limiting social mediaA new pressure that young sports stars are born into now is the spotlight of social media, and Gauff says that she has learned to avoid spending too much time online. "I'm really rarely on Twitter or Instagram. I'm just there to like my friends' posts and comment and then log off again," she says. "I would say TikTok is the only one that I'm on the most, just because I don't see much tennis, I don't see much about me on the app, which I like."Resisting the temptation to try and please everyone on social media is important, Gauff believes. "I feel like a lot of people have a lot of nice things to say, I would say definitely the positive outweighs the bad. But I guess, you know, I feel like as a human you kind of want to look at what people are saying to you and saying about you. "As humans, we have it in our heads to please everyone, so you want to know what bad things people think about you so you can fix it. But some things are just, you just can't fix it. And so I just kind of stay off it."Gauff said she tries not to spend too much time on social media.It is a single-minded philosophy that seems to extend to other areas of her life, too. Gauff is a firm believer in following your own path for your own reasons. "If you're not doing it for yourself, then don't waste your time doing it," she says. "Because you have to remember this is going to be your life and you don't want to spend the only life that you have being miserable."Making every moment count is a part of that, she says. "I think every day counts, whether it's something little that you do every day, it's a chance to improve. The sun goes up and down every day and you want to make sure you make the most of the time that matters in between."

94,,(CNN)England's Tommy Fleetwood and American Tom Hoge finished Thursday with an early share of the Players Championship lead after a weather-disrupted opening day. The first round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events was initially delayed by over an hour due to over an inch of rain falling overnight at TPC Sawgrass, Florida. And then later in the day, play was delayed by four hours and 14 minutes after thunderstorms rolled into the area. The delays and an early finish because of darkness meant that more than half of the field were unable to finish their opening rounds. Fleetwood, who has gone two years since his last victory, was one of those who was able to finish, shooting a six-under-par 66 to lead with Hoge. Read MoreFleetwood plays his third shot on the par four, 14th hole during the first round of the Players Championship.The 31-year-old returned from the delay with three straight birdies to really kickstart his round, saying that he was "quite happy when the delay came" as it allowed him to practice certain putts. "I'm chuffed to be in on that score," Fleetwood said. "I felt like I drove the ball well aside from a couple, and I felt like I chipped and putted great. For sure, that was the most I could have got out of the round. So days like that are very, very pleasing."Six players from the early side of the draw did not finish, meaning they will return early on Friday morning to play just one or two holes before getting the rest of the day off while 12 players never even hit a tee shot.England's Ian Poulter was one of those who did finish, but he had to inject some speed to complete his 18 holes. With the horn looming to halt play for darkness, the 46-year-old sped through the final two holes in attempt to avoid an early start. By ruling, a group can finish any hole that they have started before the horn sounded. Poulter subsequently sprinted round the lake on the famous par-three 17th hole to cheers from the crowd, claiming a rapid birdie before running to the 18th tee box. Having alerted the group in front of him -- who moved to the side of the fairway -- he smashed his drive on the final hole way to the right, salvaging a par and finishing with a one-over 73. It's not the first time Poulter has done this at TPC Sawgrass, as the Englishman sprinted round the 17th in 2011.

And with more poor weather scheduled for Friday, he isn't predicting taking to the course. "I'm very excited, I don't think we're going to play tomorrow," Perez said. "It's nice, it's nice. Now I don't have to do s**t tomorrow. It's perfect."Perez added: "Poulter just said I'm running. He's done it before. God bless him ... I told him, I would have had a heart attack running around the water."

96,,(CNN)After one of the most tumultuous weeks in the history of the club, the drama continued for Chelsea on their return home Sunday.Kai Havertz scored a sublime winner moments from time to steal a 1-0 victory against a valiant Newcastle United side on the Blues' first game at Stamford Bridge since owner Roman Abramovich -- who had been looking to sell the club -- was sanctioned by the UK government.The Russian oligarch's sanctioning held a number of massive implications for Chelsea, which was allowed to continue playing under a special license but unable to buy or sell players, issue new contracts to existing players, sell new tickets to upcoming games or sell any club merchandise.As rumors continue to swirl of prospective new owners, uncertainty reigns with supporters arriving at Stamford Bridge under the most unusual of pre-match circumstances.Abramovich remains a figure of gratitude for many supporters at the club -- his ownership overseeing an unprecedented era of success, including two UEFA Champions League titles -- with his name chanted by fans during the team's previous two away league matches.Read MoreOn a stand in one corner of the ground, a banner featuring Abramovich's face on the Russian flag with the words, "The Roman Empire," remained visible throughout the match.A banner in the colors of Russia's national flag, and depicting an image of Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich, is pictured in the stands on Sunday.However, a display which had been planned for Abramovich by supporters group We Are the Shed did not go ahead.One of the group's founders, Richard Weekes, had told CNN last week that they were planning a display to be shown before kick-off, but ahead of the game, the group said they would be pausing any such plans while circumstances are "constantly changing.""For the time being we are holding off with any type of displays since the current situation is constantly changing," the tweet read.Roman Abramovich: Death and destruction in Ukraine overshadows Russian oligarch's legacy at ChelseaAhead of kick-off, Chelsea technical performance advisor Petr Cech said that the club was taking it "day by day.""We hope the situation will be clearer soon," Cech, former goalkeeper with the club, told Sky Sports."We hope people working for the club will be able to get their salaries. It's a day-to-day situation ... without answers, it is difficult to plan."We go day by day and we hope the new owner will come and want to continue the legacy on the pitch because we are a team that wants to win and do our best," Cech added.Graffiti is seen on boarding at a construction site next to Chelsea Football Club at Stamford Bridge on March 11.'I'll stick to the football'The tumultuous context around the club's ownership was made all the more intriguing by the circumstances of the opposition, Newcastle United, who in October were taken over by a Saudi-Arabian backed consortium.The three-party consortium includes the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Its involvement in the takeover of Newcastle has been a long-running saga in English football, during which time Saudi Arabia's human rights record -- including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- has come under scrutiny.Their club became the richest in the world. But these fans are worried at what it means for Newcastle's soulSaudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades, according to Reuters.A Saudi Arabia flag -- as well as a Ukrainian flag -- was visible in the Newcastle supporters' away end. Asked about the executions after the game, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told reporters he would "stick to the football.""I'm still bitterly disappointed about the result," Howe added.Havertz, the controversial heroMuch of his disappointment stemmed from Havertz's role as matchwinner, with Howe alleging that the German should not have been on the pitch to score his late decider.Havertz was booked for an elbow on Newcastle defender Dan Burn during the first-half, with the video assistant referee (VAR) not deeming it serious enough to be a red card.Having frustrated the hosts for the majority of the game, more perceived injustice followed for Newcastle in the second-half when Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah looked to have fouled Jacob Murphy in the box, yet no penalty was given.Havertz's late goal took the points, but Newcastle manager Eddie Howe believed the German should not have been on the pitch."Dan [Burn] thinks it's a clear red," Howe told reporters. "It could've been given. "The one I'm most disappointed with and don't understand how it's not been given is the penalty ... Jacob Murphy's had his shirt ripped off his back near enough."It is said that football is often a cruel mistress, and for Newcastle, she stayed true to script as Havertz -- moments from the end of regulation time -- plucked Jorginho's superb pass out of the sky with a deft touch before poking past Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka.Cue delirium at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea, despite all the noise, secured a fifth consecutive win in the Premier League.
97,,(CNN)With sirens blaring and explosions in the distance, it suddenly dawned on a fearful 20-year-old soccer player that he was in the middle of a warzone.What Amilcar Djau Codjovi, who plays for Ukrainian soccer club Vorskla Poltava, didn't know was that he would spend the next two days frantically traveling the length and breadth of the country trying to find an escape route from Ukraine.In the end, his safe passage into Hungary was only secured after a call from the Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković."February 22 was my birthday, and the very next night I heard gunshots," Djau Codjovi, who recently rounded out his teens, told CNN Sport."I told my team 'oh yeah those are fireworks' and then I went to sleep that night (February 23)," at the club's accommodation.Read MoreHis slumber was abruptly broken in the early hours of the following morning after the alarm sounded around the city of Poltava, central Ukraine. He checked his phone and saw five missed calls from his parents as the invasion became a reality.Oleksandr Usyk: 'My soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor to my country,' says heavyweight champion after joining Ukrainian defense battalion"That's when I start panicking," said Djau Codjovi, who was born in Spain to parents from the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau."I was like 'oh my days.' I opened my suitcase and put everything inside," he said."And then I went outside to see what's going on and all my teammates were saying they invaded Ukraine, it is actually happening."Earlier in February during a training camp in Turkey, Djau Codjovi said his parents, Amadeo and Sika Marie, as well as agent Soriebah Kajue, had pleaded with him not to go back to Ukraine with the drums of war beating louder.Djau Codjovi says Vorskla played down the threat or war -- describing them as Russian "propaganda" -- and assured the players that they had backup plans should they need to evacuate them at short notice. At the time, much of the world wasn't sure of Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, even as he massed troops at the border.As a young player with hopes of breaking into the first team ahead of the Ukrainian Premier League's resumption on February 25, Djau Codjovi opted to return in pursuit of his soccer dream.That dream quickly turned into a nightmare.Amilcar Djau Codjovi had been playing for Vorskla Poltava in Ukraine prior to the Russian invasion. READ: Ukraine and Benfica star tears up after receiving standing ovation'Everyone for themselves'When the Russians started attacking Kharkiv, which is 160 kilometers away from Vorskla, Djau Codjovi says he was told by his coach Iurii Maksymov that he should wait at the club's accommodation while the player's travel plans were being arranged.But Djau Codjovi soon realized that he was on his own after he said some of his teammates, who were already plotting their way out, told him it was a case of "everyone for themselves."CNN has contacted Vorskla and Maksymov for comment on Djau Codjovi's version of events but did not get a response at the time of publishing.Loaded with water, chips and chocolate for the 1,500 kilometer journey, a group of 10 players and their families, including a toddler, hit the road unsure of what would await them.After initially deciding to drive to the Polish border, they were informed of long lines of traffic and waiting times, so the traveling party headed towards the Hungarian border.Petrol was scarce, the roads were full of potholes, and travel at night was challenging as explosions and gunfire could be heard.Then disaster struck when one of the cars had a flat tire.JUST WATCHEDUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasion 03:21"We had to stop," Djau Codjovi said. "And then you could see the big tanks going past and I was scared, because I thought it was Russian troops.""It was like 5 a.m. and nobody was going to stop and help."In fact the tanks rolling by were the Ukrainian army, according to Djau Codjovi, but that did little to reassure him as he was concerned that Russian troops could open fire on them and his party would be caught in the crossfire.After a delay of several hours and finally organizing a spare wheel, they were back on the road, before a short pitstop to sleep and get their energy back.On day two of their journey, they boarded a minivan, optimistically heading to the Hungarian border where they would be dropped off.Freedom in sight"After driving 10 hours to the border, we get there. We are obviously happy that we are finally here, but we got there and they say, 'no, you can't go through walking, you need a vehicle," said Djau Codjovi, with frustration etched across his face."We were literally stranded outside in the cold, it was freezing. It's like a 20-second ride ... some people were actually bringing cars there and empty minivans but charging people ... $1,600 per person. At that point I just gave up."READ: Ukraine to send full delegation to 2022 Winter ParalympicsDjau-Codjovi managed to safely escape Ukraine via Hungary. When it seemed as if all hope was lost, help came from an unlikely source -- the Croatian Prime Minister Plenković."My Croatian teammate Ivan Pešić was calling his embassy, while we sat down and were just giving up," said Djau Codjovi."Then he called out to us -- 'come quick, come quick' -- so all the group we were together .... and the Prime Minister of Croatia, he called the embassy in Kyiv and they contacted the border and then they let us through."CNN has contacted the Croatian government and messaged Pešic on Instagram and on his email for further comment but didn't receive a reply at the time of publishing.Once in Hungary, Djau Codjovi contacted his family to let them know he was safe and enjoyed his first hot meal in days while in Budapest."It was just the best McDonalds I've ever had in my life. It tasted so nice," he said.Tennis star Elina Svitolina says all prize money she wins at Monterrey Open will go to Ukrainian armyHowever, that meal didn't compare to his mom's home cooking on his arrival in Manchester, England, when she made him his favorite Ivorian food four long days after he embarked on his great escape."I just felt good, but more for my family because I know my parents were not sleeping," he added.Djau Codjovi has since vowed he won't return to Ukraine."Even when the war finishes, I don't think football will be the same. To recover from a war doesn't take a couple of years, it takes a lot of time," he said.Djau Codjovi's hopes of playing in European competition for Vorskla Poltava might be over, but he's keen to restart his career in Spain or England -- given the opportunity.He was born in Spain and lived there for 15 years before his family relocated to England. He had trials with Premier League teams Liverpool and Aston Villa, before eventually joining Morecambe where he made the first-team bench several times as a 16-year-old, though he ultimately failed to earn a pro deal there.He joined Vorskla Poltava in the summer of 2020 but sustained a knee injury which meant he had to return to the UK for treatment. However, this season saw him break into the first team, making seven appearances before the winter break and scoring a memorable goal against Lviv.If his dream of being a top soccer player is deferred for now, the 20-year-old has plenty of time on his side. More importantly, he's alive.

I wasn't happy," he said."The tennis world wanted me to be a certain player, and I was trying to be something that I wasn't for so many years. It put me in a dark place. I was letting people down, I fell out with my family. It was tough," he said."One day I looked in the mirror and said that this isn't the type of person that I'm trying to be.

101,,(CNN)Tom Brady's 'final' career touchdown ball has sold for $518,000 at auction, according to the auction site Lelands.Two days after the auction closed, however, the 44-year-old quarterback announced that he would be returning for his 23rd season in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, following a six-week retirement. The $518,000 ball featured during the Buccaneers' home playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams on January 23. Brady threw the ball 55 yards to wide receiver Mike Evans who scored a touchdown to cut the Rams' lead to seven, 27-20, with 3:20 left to play in the game. Despite their comeback from 27-3 down, the Bucs eventually lost 30-27.Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans catches what was thought to have been Tom Brady's last NFL touchdown throw ever -- until Brady came out of retirement on March 13.Immediately after the game, Brady was still uncertain about his future playing career. When he announced his retirement a week later, it gave the ball extra significance as it became what was then considered his final career touchdown ball. Read MoreRather than being preserved in a museum, the ball had reached the public domain because Evans had tossed it into the stands in celebration where it was caught by a lucky spectator. Lelands used marks and numbers on the ball to photo match it and verify its authenticity. Last year, Lelands also auctioned Brady's first career touchdown ball for $428,841 which was similarly tossed into the stands by the receiver who caught it, Terry Glenn. In between engineering these two touchdowns, Brady won seven Super Bowls -- an all-time record -- and became the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards (84,520), touchdown passes (624), completions (7,263), regular season wins (243), playoff wins (35) and Super Bowl MVPs (five).
102,,(CNN)Tom Brady will return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season, the seven-time Super Bowl winner announced Sunday.Brady confirmed on Twitter that he would be returning from a short retirement."These past two months I've realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands," Brady tweeted. "That time will come. But it's not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I'm coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG." The announcement comes one day after Brady was seen visiting members of the Glazer family, which owns the Buccaneers, at a Manchester United match.In February, Brady announced his retirement from the NFL. Brady had just finished his 22nd season in the league -- and second with the Buccaneers. Read More"We are thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season. We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement and today's announcement is something we have been preparing for in recent days," Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said in a statement. "Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level. With this decision now made, we will continue to move forward with our offseason plans to reload this roster for another championship run," Licht added.Head coach Bruce Arians said Brady "loves to play football as much as anyone I have ever been around." "He is still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship," Arians said in a statement.Brady has won seven Super Bowl titles -- six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- and is the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards (84,520), touchdown passes (624), completions (7,263), regular season wins (243), playoff wins (35) and Super Bowl MVPs (five). He has also played in and won more regular-season games in his career than any other quarterback.Selected 199th overall in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Patriots, Brady played 20 seasons in Foxborough before leaving New England as a free agent after the 2020 season and signed with the Bucs, where he led the team to a Super Bowl win in his first season there.

104,,(Reuters)Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton played down his chances of starting the Formula One season with a win and said on Saturday his Mercedes lacked a 'considerable amount' of pace.The season begins in Bahrain next week and Hamilton, hoping to win back the title from Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a controversial end to the 2021 season, took the underdog position."At the moment, I'm sure everyone can figure that out, we are not the quickest," the 37-year-old Briton told reporters on the final day of pre-season testing at the Sakhir circuit."I think Ferrari look to be the quickest and perhaps Red Bull and then maybe us or McLaren. We're currently not at the top."Asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to fight for the championship, Hamilton said it was too early and expressed confidence in his team's proven ability to work through any problems.F1 world champion Max Verstappen signs new deal with Red Bull Racing until 2028Read MoreMercedes have won the last eight constructors' championships.Hamilton said the new car had shown decent reliability and the team had got through their test programme but it was clear there remained much to do."At the moment I don't think we'll be competing for wins," he said."There is potential within our car to get us there, we've just got to learn to be able to extract it... we have some hurdles to overcome."Next week we'll get a much better showing of our pace but I think people will be surprised, maybe. People keep talking about (whether) we're talking ourselves down or not but it's a bit different this year."Mercedes's rivals have taken such declarations with some scepticism in the past.Last year Mercedes had a troubled pre-season, completing the fewest laps of any team, but Hamilton still won the opening race in Bahrain.Max Verstappen wins first F1 world title after dramatic Abu Dhabi Grand Prix endingIn 2019, Mercedes had looked up to half a second off Ferrari's pace in testing and then finished one-two in Melbourne.This season has radically revised rules and Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver of all time with a record 103 wins, said it felt different."I think we have far bigger challenges this time," he said. "It will take a little bit longer. From what I'm told, we have a considerable amount of pace to find."AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, who followed the Mercedes closely on Saturday and observed Hamilton's struggles with the car, was prepared to agree."I think they do have some work to be fighting right at the top, but it's only testing," said the Frenchman.

Just personal, keep your head up."It was just what I believe a good human being should do."He did not discuss the war or politics.Formula One's governing body, the FIA, has said Russian and Belarusian drivers could still take part in competitions in a neutral capacity.Mazepin said he had intended to do that, citing the example of tennis player Daniil Medvedev who has been allowed to continue playing, but not under the Russian flag.He said he had not given up his dreams of competing in Formula One, would stay in race condition ready for any opportunity and had no plan to seek a license from another country.Medvedev has been allowed to continue competing.The foundation, whose name echoes F1's "We Race as One" initiative to promote diversity and equal rights, would start by helping Russian Paralympic athletes sent home from the Beijing Games, he added."The foundation will allocate resources ... to those athletes who have spent their lives preparing for Olympics or Paralympics or other top events only to find they were forbidden from competing and collectively punished just because of the passports they held," he said.Mazepin, who would have been Russia's sole F1 driver this year and whose career has been funded by his father, said the foundation planned to help athletes from all conflict zones.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to sanctions across global sport, and Belarus, a key staging area for the full-scale invasion, has also been punished.

107,,(CNN)At 38, Benjamin Alexander became Jamaica's first ever alpine skier to compete in the Winter Olympics -- just six years after he first strapped on skis. In his first few years in the sport, skiing with friends, he attracted a lot of attention. "Being the only Black representative in the group, even though I am only half-Black and being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing jokes, sideways jokes at me about 'Cool Runnings,' the Jamaican bobsled team and, 'You should go to the Olympics,'" Alexander told CNN Sport. Benjamin Alexander represented Jamaica in alpine skiing -- a first for the island nation.Although the Summer Games are often heralded as a melting pot -- 11,417 athletes from 206 countries and regions across 33 sports participated in Tokyo 2020 -- the Winter Games are nowhere near as diverse, with 91 delegations taking part at Beijing 2022. That's five times more than the number of teams represented in the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924. Read MoreBut athletes from Africa, South Asia, as well as those from smaller island nations still find themselves struggling to qualify for competition in the Winter Olympics due to warmer climates, the prohibitively high cost of equipment, lack of infrastructure and limited opportunities to practice and compete.  And one athlete and his coaches that CNN interviewed for this story warn that continental quota systems that allowed countries and regions with smaller Winter Olympic delegations the opportunity to establish and expand in sliding sports in PyeongChang 2018 were scrapped ahead of Beijing, with a knock-on effect on African countries.  A push for diversity, with limited success More countries are making their debut in the Winter Olympics.Saudi Arabia and Haiti each sent an alpine skier to Beijing while Nigeria and Eritrea competed in the Winter Games for the second time after making their debut in PyeongChang 2018. In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number. But just five African countries participated in this year's Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia. European and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.  But climate isn't the only factor affecting Olympic participation -- when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations. At PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway -- one of the world's wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million -- topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it "aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone."  It allocates a "substantial portion" of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help "athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need." Some 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to "support qualification efforts," according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships. Only NOCs "whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record" had access to the program, the IOC said. Meanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.  Athletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000.  European athletes received most funding from Olympic scholarships ahead of 2022 Winter Games Of the $7.5 million in scholarships issued ahead of Beijing 2022, athletes from Europe collectively received more than $5 million while athletes in Africa received just $177,000, according to the 2017-2020 IOC Olympic Solidarity report.Olympic Scholarships for athletes allocated to National Olympic Committee (NOC) ahead of Beijing 2022(Rollover rectangles below for detail)(Tap rectangles below for detail) EuropeAmericasAsiaAfricaOceania Source: International Olympic committee Scholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds -- derived from Olympic revenue -- towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.  CNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding. Racial diversity not reflected On a national level, the composition of delegations often isn't very racially diverse. "There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don't know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries," Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport. Black athletes have proven crucial to Team USA's Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.  But even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing -- speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history -- White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year. Prior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.  In 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA's first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies' figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002. Hockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US. Four years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy. Overall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.  Surya Bonaly of France performs a backflip in her free skate routine in the women's Olympic figure skating in Nagano on February 20, 1998.Bonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics -- an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges -- which she landed on one foot.  That move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition."They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way," Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, "people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that's good. And it's more accepted."Bonaly added: "Now, back then ... you only came from one mold, one way."Black athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America's Olympic bobsled team. Nathan Chen skates during the Men's Free Skating program at Beijing 2022 on February 10, 2022.Asian American athletes, including figure skater Nathan Chen and snowboarder Chloe Kim, have also had a commanding presence at this year's Games. Four of the six Team USA singles figure skaters were Asian American: Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Alysa Liu and Vincent Zhou. Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women's hockey player in US team history.  Pay to play economics Experts say that economics -- not just talent -- plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics. "That notion of economics is very key because we're looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating -- and that equipment alone costs so much," Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.  "Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money," Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN. "It becomes not just a racialized issue, it's a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody's going to be a working-class hero," she said.  With stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children's Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.  Ghana's first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.  "This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay," he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season. Jamaica's first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: "I'm competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young."  "And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement," he said. In 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes' rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable. The athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.  Shiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India's only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.  "Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don't have the systems in place that enable a successful career. "Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach," he added. Many elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they're growing up.  Bode Miller -- the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals -- attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he "wouldn't have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia." Parents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has "earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries."  Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.The study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.  "If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski," Alexander told CNN. "If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don't have as much disposable income as their White counterparts," Alexander said. Adding that he doesn't think" winter sports are racist at all," Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports. "I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology ... then I believe the tide will turn." In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it "fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games."  "We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality," it added."Some sports in all reality are more accessible," James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.  "But you can't sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you've got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there's factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven," he said.  "And that's not something that us at the IOC are going to change.  "All sports have different levels of access," Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport "tries to look at." The IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations "to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports' structures and priorities."  "Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport," it added.  Infrastructure challenges Winter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia -- notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an "unexplored market" in India, Keshavan said.  "For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.  "We don't really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities," he said. This year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India's nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.  Khan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport. Shiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. "Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment," he said. "Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training," he added. Athletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come. Frimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don't necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow. "But that doesn't matter," he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said."You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I'll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It's not like it's impossible," he said. "Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in," Macleod told CNN adding: "That's within the remit of the national government." "Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure," Macleod said. "We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa -- that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs," he added. "Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, 'Actually, we're not going to invest in winter sports because that's not a priority for us.'"'We're going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.' And they will always have to make that choice of where they're going to put their funding and what programs from our side they're going to apply for," he said. "We put at the disposal of our stakeholders -- whether it's NOCs or the IFs (international federations) -- a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities," he said. Representation matters Carter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations' final offerings.  "For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself," she added.  In winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique. "If you don't see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do," she added. Some sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said. "But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility -- and have the bobsled -- is very limited in general," she added. Ahmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.  "We see a general trend in ... Summer Games -- you've got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You've got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes," Ahmed added. Ditching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion Frimpong and Nigeria's Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's (IBSF) continental quota system.  But the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games -- something coaches had warned would deliver a "crushing blow" to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.  Coaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that "inequitable quotas that didn't take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.  "The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport," they wrote.  Akwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.Simidele Adeagbo of Nigeria reacts as she finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on day eight of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 17, 2018."An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible," they added in the email. The quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing -- a decision which directly affected Frimpong. "Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system," an IOC representative told Frimpong's coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN. "I qualified as Ghana's first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa," Frimpong told CNN.  Frimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.  "Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games -- to be able to qualify outright," he told CNN. On December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics. Frimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant "I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good -- maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever -- but I'm good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners."  Frimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports "for qualified African athletes who can safely compete." "We're not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we're not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card."But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there's enough African athletes," he added. In a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.  "To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022," the organization said in a statement. No athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal. "We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it's less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it's disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority," Frimpong added. But there is hope -- even if only for a select few athletes.American bobsledder Meyers Taylor's bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis' four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.When asked about passing Davis' record saying, she said: "That is overwhelming. It's so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I'm part of a legacy that's bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody."We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be. "So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports."UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the IOC's most recent individual Olympic Solidarity scholarship data.CNN's Homero De La Fuente contributed reporting.

109,,(CNN)It's the fuel that powers performance -- few things are as important to an elite athlete as their diet.Eating the right nutrients is critical to success, but so is the odd indulgent meal to keep spirits high through grueling training sessions. And as the Winter Olympics comes to an end, a new cookbook provides a glimpse into what makes top athletes tick.The Winning Recipes cookbook is the idea of the Purple Project, an organization that looks to support domestic abuse survivors, which has worked over the past year to create a gastronomic tome made up of the favorite recipes from some of the US' best Olympic athletes. "The Purple Project reached out to me out of the blue," retired Olympic skier Noah Hoffman, who was invited to take part, told CNN Sport. Read More"At first, I thought, 'That's a little strange, I'm not a chef. I don't know if I can contribute to a cookbook.' "But, of course, I love to cook.

113,,(CNN)The feeling of total vulnerability is something that would prevent most from trying rock climbing, but for Lor Sabourin, it's what they love most about the sport. Being so far out of their comfort zone, tackling a route that requires both mental and physical fortitude, provides Sabourin with an opportunity to reflect and work through the challenges in their life. In many ways, it's much more than just a sport for them -- it's a way of exploring identity which has helped them accept who they are. "I think it's really hard to hide from the stress of climbing. When you go out, you're really choosing to be vulnerable," Sabourin tells CNN Sport."You don't have to do that everywhere else in life.Read More"People are able to really find out how they do best when they're in stress and to learn better ways to respond to stress and to things like fear and insecurity." Sabourin has recently released a film with Patagonia that explores their life as a non-binary climber, following Sabourin as they take on one of the hardest routes of their life in the sandstone canyons of northern Arizona. It provided Sabourin with a chance to speak about their journey and address what it means for them to be a trans climber in 2021.In tackling some dark periods of their life -- including battles with eating disorders, self-harm and sexual assault -- the film "They/Them" shows how Sabourin has learned to thrive in the climbing community. "Making the film was hard in a lot of ways because, so often when we go through something hard and then come out on the other side, we want to just pretend that that didn't happen," they added."So I really had to go back to parts of my story that maybe I didn't talk about with people in my life very often. "And that was at first really challenging, but over time, it actually became really healing."

It may seem improbable now when you see photos of them hanging off the side of a rock face, but there was a time when they were too scared to use the three-meter slide at their local swimming pool. In truth, climbing wasn't something that came naturally, but sport always played a major role in their upbringing. They were a strong runner throughout their education but finally fell into climbing as a way of combining competition with their love of the outdoors. "[Climbing] is very all-consuming," Sabourin said. "Running, for example, it's like your mind can go anywhere and you can still run quite quickly."And that's one of my favorite things about running is having a place where I can just let my mind go, and climbing isn't really that way. "When you're climbing, you have to have 100% of your attention on what you're doing. And that's really therapeutic in its own way."

However, as their profile within the sport becomes more well-known, Sabourin has had to deal with online hate and microaggressions from within the community, such as people reacting angrily about using different pronouns. In the film, they describe how they were subject to online abuse after an interview with climbing magazine "Rock and Ice" was published. There are also times in normal life where Sabourin feels less safe than their non-trans friends. "I guess that's really challenging, especially having a background of experiencing pretty extreme violence at a young age for my identity," they said. "With the film, it definitely brings up that fear. I am putting myself out there in a really public way, and so it's definitely opening up to the potential for more of that to happen."But [...] in all of those interactions, people didn't take the time to get to know me."What I feel is really powerful about the film [...] is you kind of have to stay with me long enough to learn that I'm a human just like anyone else and that being trans is one aspect. "Something that I really love about myself is my identity, but it actually is a fairly small aspect of my identity in the grand scheme of things." READ: Two world-class climbers scale the tallest chimney in EuropeSabourin wants to be a positive role model to others. Becoming a role model The process of making the film was an intimate affair, with Sabourin often being joined just by co-director and friend Blake McCord. They didn't want the film to make generalizations about the trans experience, but instead share their own unique story in a humanistic way. Sabourin is aware that they may become the face for the wider community as a result. At a time when trans people are facing scrutiny in both the sporting arena and in wider society, Sabourin says climbing has an opportunity to create a more inclusive framework that other sports can follow. "I think it could be simpler than people believe," they said. "They get so hung up in the political debates and the legislation."If we look at the value of sports to people, as humans, and the reasons that we participate and we strip it down back to that human aspect, it's a lot simpler than we think it is."Sabourin says the thought of being a role model feels similar to tackling climbing projects -- intimidating, but also inspiring -- and admits the thought of people looking up to them has made them become more honest in their personal life. The American has struggled with eating disorders since they were seven or eight years old and wants to trigger conversations about how it can affect both athletes and the trans community. Now in recovery, Sabourin has learned to adopt a healthier relationship with food and exercise and has realized the destructive ways in which they were using food to manage their transition. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresThey say the topic still isn't spoken about enough. "I've tried my best to be a combination of holding myself really accountable and being really firm with myself about taking steps every day, but also give myself some levity around it and not always feel like I'm beating my head against the wall," Sabourin said. "I want people to have a role model that's someone who takes care of themselves, who lives a life that they think is meaningful. "I also personally want to be a person who has those things for myself."
114,,(CNN)It was a chance encounter that would change her life forever. In 2017, Nadhira Alharthy met the first Omani man to climb Everest.Khalid al-Siyabi had summited Everest seven years earlier. He was part of a group of pioneering Omanis who were telling their inspirational stories at an assembly hosted by the Ministry of Education, where Alharthy was working as the director of citizenship at the time.  That evening she made a pledge to replicate al-Siyabi's achievement, using his mentorship as guidance."His story, it touched me," she tells CNN Sport. "I was inspired to do something for myself [...] to challenge myself."Building up her strengthRead MoreBefore training to climb the world's tallest mountain, Alharthy's workout routine extended to going to the gym a few times a week. She knew she had to dramatically change gears, beginning with strengthening her muscles and improving her resistance. With al-Siyabi's help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving. The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. "Training the mind [...] it's harder than training our bodies," she says. In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy's ambition was al-Siyabi. "We kept it as a secret for a long time," she says.She wasn't just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: "I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience."The endurance athlete says she takes advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain. She recently visited Jabal Akhdar, part of the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman. 'I was very lucky'In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition. "They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety," she says.Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team -- including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. "I started feeling worried about him. But I said, 'OK, he will make it, he's strong,'" she says.A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: "Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing."In January 2021, Alharthy became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam, Nepal. His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn't just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi's memory as well.  "He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me," she says. "I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of [...] the climb."After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi's summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain. The poetry of their story isn't lost on her, acknowledging that "the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest]." She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: "I was very lucky to have them [...] it brought us all together."Two years later, Alharthy's face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. "It's not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping," she says. "It was a different type of happiness."Ama DablamWhile participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers. In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) -- a mountain south of Everest -- while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar. "I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad [...] he messaged me that he was going," says Alharthy."I told him, I'm not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it's winter season and that's very difficult."

At home, they were betrayed'The Fight of the Century': A divided US nation 50 years onFootball club founded by Turkish immigrants creates stir in Germany Olympian pressured to 'perform better' and lose a few poundsHaving unsuccessfully attempted the same climb in 2018, Alharthy was "scared of failing again," but she knew that Badar's moral support, coupled with her training for Everest, would set her in good stead. "I felt that I was prepared."With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet. She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest. "There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it's like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time," she adds. "If we miss anything, it's very dangerous." Over the past year, Alharthy hasn't had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she's been taking advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain -- most recently visiting the country's epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles. "I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically," she says.Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders. Rock formations in the Al Hoota natural cave after it re-opened to the public for the first time in three years near the ancient city of Jizwa in Oman's northern Dakhiliya region on September 2016. Finding solidarity through faithCementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight. Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining. Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. "I was feeling depressed," she says. "I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for." Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith. Alharthy says she hopes her story will inspire young Omanis to participate in endurance sports. 
Ahead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. "Our faith [...] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power."Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. "For them, it's something very exposed, it's something very unsafe. My mom, she's waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again," she says. "They support me to do what I want, but they are worried."She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story. "When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it's now becoming quite common," she recently told the Times. Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. "They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights," she says.Mount Ama Dablam, which peaks at 6,812 meters (22,349 feet), in the Everest region.'Believe in your dream'Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry's mantra -- to figuratively "die empty" from sharing knowledge: "I think that's what Khalid was doing with many Omanis." "I think it's a great story," she goes on to tell CNN. "Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves." She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager's assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world's highest peak at age 75. "He's very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us," she says. "Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard."Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots. "I always wake up in the morning and say, 'Alhumdullilah, thank God I'm here [...] I reached my goal," she says.
115,,(CNN)Janja Garnbret can't remember a time when she wasn't climbing. As a child growing up in Slovenia, she'd regularly be found racing up trees or scaling the door frames in her house, but it was on the climbing wall where she felt most at home and where her talent eventually shone through. Yet despite being one of the favorites to win gold at this year's Tokyo Olympics, Garnbret's career didn't get off to the start you might expect. She came last in her category in her first competition as a child but says she loved the sport too much to care at that stage. "People always ask me if I was ever comparing myself to other kids, I was actually not," Garnbret, who recently scaled Europe's tallest chimney, tells CNN Sport. Read More"I was just enjoying myself on the wall and I was just climbing, trying to push my limits. I never thought to myself that I am better than everyone else. I just enjoyed climbing." After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country. Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently. She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut. READ: Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' Slovenia's Janja Garnbret says she's looking forward to making her Olympic debut in Tokyo. 'I learned a lot about myself'The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around. She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country's lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn't expected. "I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation," she says."I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn't know myself like that."It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly."Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again. Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she'll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week."I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn't know what to expect, how to deal with it," she adds."But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It's still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics."READ: The climbers aiming to boost diversity in the sport JUST WATCHEDClimbing Europe's tallest chimneyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClimbing Europe's tallest chimney 02:59Driving four hours a dayShould sport climbing make its debut at this year's Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees -- sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance. She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions. It's a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile. "I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit," she says. "I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold.""I can't say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that. "I will definitely keep training and I will be prepared as much as possible when the time comes and then we will see what will happen. But, definitely, I'm looking forward to it." READ: Emily Harrington on her historic El Capitan climbGarnbret says the global pandemic initally knocked her motivation. Promoting healthy climbing While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year's Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that. "I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It's super young," she says. "So it's definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That's definitely something huge." Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country. She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results. She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success."I just want to set a good example in that you don't need to lose extra weight to be successful," she says. "I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it's always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself." She continues: "I remember I fell in love [...] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall. I remember that I was the only kid who stayed on the wall and didn't want to come off."

Stoltman has autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, often presented in restricted, repetitive patterns. "[Growing up] I didn't have a clue that I was doing anything wrong," Stoltman recalls. "All my behaviors and the stuff I was doing, like in the house, out of the house, to my parents, siblings, etc., I thought was normal."I thought the other kids, doing different things, were the ones that were in the wrong."As Stoltman became a teenager, his social issues intensified, until "something just clicked in my brain" and he decided to tell his closest friends at school."I stood up and took my seven or eight best mates into a room and said, 'Look, I have autism.'"And they said, "Look, there's no problem at all.

But I kept going and kept on pushing myself and Luke kept on pushing me."I knew he was obviously the best in the country, so I was just always wanting to try to get close to him.

And at six foot, eight inches, the young Scotsman had a prodigious appetite, which soon became key for his new found way of life given the need to 'bulk up.'"Even when I was a younger kid, I was taking four or five sandwiches to school for lunch.

Tom Stoltman competes in the World's Ultimate Deadlift competition in Dubai, UAE in October 2019.A decade later, in order to prepare his body for the merciless rigors of training and competition, Stoltman typically eats upwards of 10,000 calories a day. And as he began honing his focus on his ever-increasing strength, Stoltman was finding his autism was proving to be a valuable asset. "Having autism and [going to] the gym goes hand-in-hand," reflects Stoltman. "When you're in the gym, you need a routine. And obviously, when I found 'Strongman,' it's all routine. "You're waking up every day. You're eating the same meals every day. You're doing the same things every day. And you're going to the gym at the same time every day."However, his relentless quest to improve his performance presented challenges."Sometimes, if I missed that lift, I'll think about it for 24 hours or not talk to my wife.

117,,(CNN)Ryan Hall may hold the fastest marathon and half marathon times for a US athlete, but these days he admits that running doesn't feel like it used to. "It just feels like you're wearing a weight vest the whole time," says Hall, which is hardly a surprise when you consider his physical transformation since retiring from the sport five years ago.As a professional runner racking up 120 to 140 miles a week, Hall would weigh in at a lithe 130 pounds; today, he's 190 pounds and far more likely to be found lifting weights than grinding out 20-mile long runs.And while he may not be able to get close to his half marathon record of 59:43, nor his best marathon time of 2:04:58, the 39-year-old Hall says that he feels all the better for it. "My body was just done -- I couldn't even finish an easy, 30-minute run at that point," he tells CNN Sport as he reflects on his retirement from professional running in January 2016. Read More"I'm five foot 10, I was 127 pounds and my body was just totally depleted and in really bad shape, and I needed to get back to my body. "Weightlifting became a new medium for me to express who I am, which is a guy who loves physical challenge. I love being active. I have to work out every day or else I'm grumpy and in a bad mood."Ryan Hall on course during the LA Marathon on March 15, 2015 in Los Angeles, California.His current workout routine involves daily weightlifting sessions of 60 to 90 minutes, squeezed in around his coaching (he trains his wife Sara and 10 other professional athletes) and parenting commitments.Among the benefits of lifting compared to his running schedule, Hall says, is an increase in his energy levels, which are "10 times better" than when he was running professionally and would rely on taking two-hour afternoon naps each day. He says that his testosterone levels were always "clinically low" as a runner, with natural remedies making no difference. Hall's workout involves weightlifting sessions of 60 to 90 minutes a day."It's just a really hard profession on my body," Hall adds. "Whereas weightlifting is totally the opposite of that: it's anabolic in nature, so I'm building muscle and building strength. "It is a great way for me to give back to my body after it had given so much to me over a 20-year period. Now I did finally give back to it and I feel amazing now, my testosterone is back into the normal level, my energy's better, my motivation's better.

Rather than testing himself over the 26.2 miles of a marathon, he will take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance. Last month, for example, he took on a wood chop/water carry challenge. That involved splitting a cord of wood and running 6.3 miles to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, then 6.3 miles and 5,000 feet of elevation back up while carrying a 62-pound water jug in each hand. "It kind of reminded me of my pro running days being on the starting line of a marathon and trying to run 4:45 per mile for a marathon distance and just being like: How am I going to do this?" Hall says of the feat. "Even though you're trained, you're prepared, when you get in that moment it's a scary place."Hall plans to take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance.He's now mulling his next challenge. One goal is to try and complete a 500-pound deadlift and mile run in under five minutes (he got 5:28 for his first attempt), and another is something that involves "covering a good amount of distance with a heavy weight."However, he's hasn't entirely forgotten his love for racing marathons. Coaching his wife Sara, who has run the second-fastest marathon time ever by an American woman, serves as a reminder of that. "When I'm at Sara's races and she's super fit and she's warming up for marathons ... I just remember: Oh, how good it feels to be ripping it on the roads, feeling like a million bucks floating through it. There's no sensation like that," says Hall.He continues: "I can think back to a whole bunch of moments when it was just me out in the woods on single-track trail, no one else around, no other sounds besides the wind blowing through the trees and having that same exact sensation: being in full flight, feeling like I'm floating along."It's the sheer thrill of running that Hall tries to pass on to the runners he mentors, including his four daughters. "I try to remind my girls: Hey, it's not about the performance, it's not about what place you are. Can you just fall in love with just the sensation of your body being in flight?" says Hall. "Because if you can fall in love with that sensation, you're going to get everything out of running that you want to get out of running. "That's where the good stuff is at. It's not hitting a PR [personal record], it's not finishing a certain place or going to the Olympics or any of this stuff. It's in the beauty of the sensation of your body in full flight."JUST WATCHEDAbdi Nageeye's Olympic gestureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAbdi Nageeye's Olympic gesture 01:11Coach as chefOn top of the 11 athletes he trains personally, Hall has also started Run Free Training, an online training platform of around 150 athletes. He is, he admits, "a much better coach than I am an athlete." While he was "super rigid" with his schedule during his running career, he's learned to appreciate the value of constantly making adjustments to an athlete's training routine. "I like to see myself as almost a chef," says Hall. "When I'm writing the training, I have a 'recipe,' right? But based on what I'm seeing, based on the feedback I'm getting, it's like I'm tasting it as I'm cooking and then I'm changing up the flavors, throwing this and that in there, taking this, that out, making it just right."He has a similar approach to his own training in the weight room, making tweaks to his workouts to challenge his body in new ways. "I've got to be throwing new stimulus at my body that it hasn't seen before, so I'm constantly finding new ways to do that," says Hall."I've studied a lot of training, I get inspiration from other people's training, but then I also get creative and I do stuff that sounds fun ... I try to be really intuitive with my training."Hall has also tweaked his diet over the past few years. As he did when he was a runner, he still eats a meal or a snack every three hours, but these days he's also upped his calorie intake."I'm eating a ton of protein and I'm still eating a ton of carbs," he says. "Basically, I'm eating a lot more calories than I used to eat ... I'm trying to eat 4,500 to 5000 calories a day, and if I'm not, no matter what I'm doing in the weight room, I'm not seeing strength gains."JUST WATCHEDThe Strongman Marathon: 26.2 grueling miles of various exercisesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Strongman Marathon: 26.2 grueling miles of various exercises 03:15Away from their life in Flagstaff, Arizona, the Halls have supported development projects in Africa, which has included fundraising to bring clean water to 90,000 people in Zambia and for a new health clinic to be built in Kenya. They have also founded the Hall Steps Foundation, a non-profit organization that protects vulnerable women and children living in extreme poverty in Ethiopia. In 2015, the couple adopted their four daughters from Ethiopia; Hall says the family plans to set up an initiative there in the future. "We want to do our part to help," he adds. "Our kids are so amazing; they blessed us way more than we blessed them."Until the family can return to Ethiopia, Hall's focus remains on coaching and imparting the lessons he learned throughout his running career; it makes the injuries and setbacks all the more valuable.

118,,(CNN)It started with a two-and-a-half-mile run with his partner. Now it's a lifestyle for Robbie Balenger.He's pushed his body and mind to the very limits by taking on mammoth endurance challenges, notably running 3,175 miles across the US in just 75 days in 2019 in order to promote the benefits of a plant-based diet.More recently, Balenger broke the record for most laps around New York's Central Park in one day. His life now is in sharp contrast to when he was running successful restaurants. "I lived in Austin, Texas, and was very much a part of the food and bar scene. With that comes a lot of partying and late nights," he tells CNN.Read More"You work hard, then you blow off steam. I was still living that kind of lifestyle and quickly realized it wasn't going to add up."All that partying wasn't really going to make me a very good leader or someone that could fulfill the duties of my job every day in the way I wanted to." Then his now-fiancee invited him on a run. The short jog triggered something in Balenger, who quickly saw the advantages of exercising as a way of coping with the stresses of his job and coming up with new ideas for his restaurant. Balenger gradually took on longer and tougher challenges; a half-marathon; a full marathon; and then found himself lining up on the start line for a grueling ultra-marathon. "It definitely replaced that hard-partying lifestyle," he adds. "[It was] much healthier but there was still something in there that felt kind of similar. It's kind of a raw feeling."READ: 'We should be less afraid to be afraid,' says history making climberRobbie Balenger says he has a spiritual connection with running which has helped him forge a new identity.Run across the USBalenger eventually stepped away from the bar scene. He flirted with the idea of charity work or working in solar energy and he also liked the thought of being a wildland firefighter. But he always came back to running.Then, after a chance encounter with another man who had run across the US, Balenger started prepping for the biggest challenge of his life -- the transcontinental run.  "I completed it in 75 days, so that averaged out to 43 miles a day. So I was putting in an ultra[-marathon] every day," he says, smiling. The main drive behind the project was raising awareness of better food choices. Balenger says his vegan diet was his "superpower" for the run and insists it was one of the reasons he was able to complete it. "Here in the US especially, we have a really bad obesity problem and people are just really unhealthy," he says."I think I hit it at a time where people were willing to acknowledge and accept that there was an issue, and therefore, they were open to conversations because they were seeing people all around them who are unhealthy and getting sick."My thought was, 'I'm just going to show that I can do this on a plant based diet,' and along the way, I quickly realized not only could I do it, it was the reason I was able to do it."

In March 2021, he set a new record for The Central Park Loop Challenge, where he had to complete as many 6.1-mile laps of the park as he could within its opening hours. From 6:05 a.m. to 12:55 a.m. the next morning, Balenger ran 16 laps -- just under 100 miles -- smashing the previous record of 11 loops. "It was just super appealing to me coming out of the depths of Covid. It felt like it was a cool thing to do," he says."It was on the first day of spring and then it really resonated with me because that's where I finished my run across the United States, in Central Park."[I was] really excited to have accomplished it and then your legs seize up and you get really stiff and then you get really tired, and luckily, you can pass out right afterward." Balenger runs 10 miles every day in preparation for big challenges. Come rain or shine, he throws on his sneakers and goes outside. Consistency, he says, is key. While the thought of heading out for a run on a freezing morning might deter many, Balenger has always found a way to overcome the doubts in his mind.It's because running is more than just a physical challenge. It's his sanctuary. It's where he feels most at peace.  "Running is the most spiritual aspect of my life," he says. "It's where I go to be with myself and to explore who I am and the energies around me and who I want to be."There's something that's very beautiful in the discomfort of it [...] feeling what some would call pain -- I guess it is like a dull low pain.

Like being a guy that went out and drank a lot," he says."Partying like that was kind of embodying what I thought it meant to be a man. It was living hard and that was kind of where this masculinity showed itself." He says running helped him redefine masculinity, especially after watching athletes compete in the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run -- one of the hardest runs in the US. "I was like: there's another version of a man that is just rough and tumble and got all of those qualities that I think I was trying to get from this bar scene," he says."This is a way that is the healthier version of that. And so after seeing that, I wanted to embody that. And so that started this exploration of it and it's something that's still ongoing. "I'm 36 years old, I'm still trying to understand what that is, and I do that through my running. It helps me to create an identity for myself that is healthy, and I think embodies a lot of what it means to be a man." Balenger is currently tackling another mammoth challenge, in what he has dubbed  the "Colorado Crush."It involves running a marathon in June, a 50-mile run in July, and a 100-mile run in August. In between these, he will also bid to complete the Colorado trail -- which stretches for 500 miles -- and summit 58 peaks that are over 14,000 feet. During the challenge, he will be using neuroscience technology to see how it can optimize his sleep and help aid his recovery."I think the more we run, the more we move our body, we push ourselves, the clearer and higher our frequency becomes," he says."I think encouraging other people to do that will only better ourselves and better our communities and better the world. "I know I am the best version of myself when I have a goal, when I'm moving my body, when I'm taking care of myself and I'm eating healthy. I want that for everyone."You can follow Balenger's latest challenge on his Instagram account.

She is a mother of two who embodies power and strength.Rene Campbell has dedicated most of her life to sculpting her once diminutive frame into one that, she says, goes "completely against what society thinks a woman should look like."The bodybuilder's dedication has brought plenty of awards but building her dream body -- gaining over 85 pounds, going from a UK size 8 to 14 -- has had its challenges, too, both physically and mentally. "I was very insecure about my body image, very insecure about myself as a person," Campbell, 44, tells CNN Sport from her home in Cornwall, UK, as she reflects on her motivation to transform herself. "I was constantly feeling under pressure through the media that women needed to look a certain way.""My bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself," says Rene Campbell.Read More'A woman with muscle'"For quite some time I struggled with eating disorders because I was constantly trying to keep my weight really low, to appear skinny, like these women are on magazine covers," she says.Then, she attended a women's bodybuilding show and became intrigued by the way these seemingly confident women held themselves.Though Campbell ​says she loves the way she now looks, ​she says she is sometimes treated with cruelty, like when she has been asked to leave women's toilets. "A lot of the time you are up against a lot of negativity. People set in an old mindset," Campbell adds. "I was up against -- and still am -- a lot of criticism from people who don't understand why women would want to be muscular. But it just gave me a sense of confidence and mental strength."I'm stuck in a situation where I have to prove that I'm a woman in order to use these toilets? It's quite offensive. I do try and explain to them quite nicely. I may look this way but, at the end of the day, I am a woman. I have every right to use these toilets.""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession," says Campbell.Studying female bodybuilders For over a decade, sociologist Dr. Tanya Bunsell has been researching female bodybuilders."When I would tell people that I was studying female bodybuilders, the first reaction was, 'That's just not attractive,'" Dr. Bunsell, a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at Canterbury Christ Church University, tells CNN Sport."There's definitely a glass ceiling on muscularity, and that crossover boundary where the body becomes transgressive and interrogates people's notions of male and female."The troublesome and disturbing body of the hyper-muscular woman is deemed so outrageously deviant by society that it provokes harsh comments.""Even though there is a huge market encouraging women to build abs and tighten their figures, the ideal still stands for smaller waists, curvy hips and lean legs, the so-called hourglass figure," adds Dr. Bunsell.Campbell takes enormous pride in the way she has reshaped her body.'The body becomes an amazing machine'When she started her bodybuilding career, ​Campbell says eating copious amounts of food was, at first, a shock to the body and mind."My body temperature went up," she says, ​saying that putting on weight initially scared her."I was feeling hot all the time because you're constantly eating, but once you get over that stage the body becomes an amazing machine and it starts to take that fuel in.""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession," says Campbell."You look at any athlete that has achieved great things, there has to be a certain level of obsession."A photograph of Campbell is currently featured in a six-month exhibition in west London called "Womanhood." Max Ellis, the photographer who took the portait of Campbell, describes his subject as a "work of art." "She's worked her whole life to try and achieve this," Ellis ​said. "If you're a woman and you're doing this [bodybuilding], you are swimming upstream. You're fighting every known convention."   SteroidsBut bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle. "Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn't pass," Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women's Committee, tells CNN Sport.Campbell says it would be naïve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too."The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation," Campbell says. "My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code."And as she reflected on her body's evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health."It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself."
0,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn vector representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many message passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling (MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for each message passing step and computes the final graph representation by unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture improves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph representations.  
1,,Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient boosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and tabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers of classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular data settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these two strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be performed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as "partition and vote" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they both learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes. For inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes. This formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship between these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds of tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our focus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large fraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to excel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample sizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample sizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via further combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising this technical report in the coming months with updated results.  
2,,Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful tools for graph-structured data. However, they have been recently shown to be vulnerable to topological attacks. To enhance adversarial robustness, we go beyond spectral graph theory to robust graph theory. By challenging the classical graph Laplacian, we propose a new convolution operator that is provably robust in the spectral domain and is incorporated in the GCN architecture to improve expressivity and interpretability. By extending the original graph to a sequence of graphs, we also propose a robust training paradigm that encourages transferability across graphs that span a range of spatial and spectral characteristics. The proposed approaches are demonstrated in extensive experiments to simultaneously improve performance in both benign and adversarial situations.  
3,,With the increasing popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in several sensitive applications like healthcare and medicine, concerns have been raised over the privacy aspects of trained GNNs. More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox access to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy has emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets. Following the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE), recent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are trained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer knowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees. However, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the structural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new graph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting private training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data, partly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for each query node. We theoretically analyze our approach in the R\`{e}nyi differential privacy framework and provide privacy guarantees. Besides, we show the solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines, including the PATE baseline adapted for graph-structured data. Our anonymized code is available.  
4,,Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and accountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks. In this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed points while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box models.  
5,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models for many graph-structured tasks. Existing models often assume that a complete structure of a graph is available during training, however, in practice, graph-structured data is usually formed in a streaming fashion, so that learning a graph continuously is often necessary. In this paper, we aim to bridge GNN to lifelong learning by converting a graph problem to a regular learning problem, so that GNN is able to inherit the lifelong learning techniques developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this end, we propose a new graph topology based on feature cross-correlation, called the feature graph. It takes features as new nodes and turns nodes into independent graphs. This successfully converts the original problem of node classification to graph classification, in which the increasing nodes are turned into independent training samples. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of feature graph networks (FGN) by continuously learning a sequence of classical graph datasets. We also show that FGN achieves superior performance in human action recognition with distributed streaming signals for wearable devices.  
6,,Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, have long been applied to image and multi-media tasks, particularly those with structured data. More recently, there has been more attention to unstructured data that can be represented via graphs. These types of data are often found in health and medicine, social networks, and research data repositories. Graph convolutional neural networks have recently gained attention in the field of deep learning that takes advantage of graph-based data representation with automatic feature extraction via convolutions. Given the popularity of these methods in a wide range of applications, robust uncertainty quantification is vital. This remains a challenge for large models and unstructured datasets. Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification of model parameters for deep learning models. Although Bayesian inference has been used extensively elsewhere, its application to deep learning remains limited due to the computational requirements of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Recent advances in parallel computing and advanced proposal schemes in MCMC sampling methods has opened the path for Bayesian deep learning. In this paper, we present Bayesian graph convolutional neural networks that employ tempered MCMC sampling with Langevin-gradient proposal distribution implemented via parallel computing. Our results show that the proposed method can provide accuracy similar to advanced optimisers while providing uncertainty quantification for key benchmark problems. 
7,,A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) stacks several layers and in each layer performs a PROPagation operation (PROP) and a TRANsformation operation (TRAN) for learning node representations over graph-structured data. Though powerful, GCNs tend to suffer performance drop when the model gets deep. Previous works focus on PROPs to study and mitigate this issue, but the role of TRANs is barely investigated. In this work, we study performance degradation of GCNs by experimentally examining how stacking only TRANs or PROPs works. We find that TRANs contribute significantly, or even more than PROPs, to declining performance, and moreover that they tend to amplify node-wise feature variance in GCNs, causing variance inflammation that we identify as a key factor for causing performance drop. Motivated by such observations, we propose a variance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which scales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance degradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow ones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results with shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and can well generalize to other GNN architectures. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/miafei/NodeNorm.  
8,,Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for unstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for graph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty of incorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer framework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer - residual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural information as well as node information. It allows us to use global self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and comes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. In addition, we introduce a generalized positional encoding scheme for graphs based on Singular Value Decomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which relies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared to Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks, which rely on local feature aggregation within a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised learning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our findings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive bias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive alternative.  
9,,Link prediction is one of the key problems for graph-structured data. With the advancement of graph neural networks, graph autoencoders (GAEs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) have been proposed to learn graph embeddings in an unsupervised way. It has been shown that these methods are effective for link prediction tasks. However, they do not work well in link predictions when a node whose degree is zero (i.g., isolated node) is involved. We have found that GAEs/VGAEs make embeddings of isolated nodes close to zero regardless of their content features. In this paper, we propose a novel Variational Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE) that utilize L2-normalization to derive better embeddings for isolated nodes. We show that our VGNAEs outperform the existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/VGNAE.  
10,,Data augmentation has been widely used in image data and linguistic data but remains under-explored on graph-structured data. Existing methods focus on augmenting the graph data from a global perspective and largely fall into two genres: structural manipulation and adversarial training with feature noise injection. However, the structural manipulation approach suffers information loss issues while the adversarial training approach may downgrade the feature quality by injecting noise. In this work, we introduce the local augmentation, which enhances node features by its local subgraph structures. Specifically, we model the data argumentation as a feature generation process. Given the central node's feature, our local augmentation approach learns the conditional distribution of its neighbors' features and generates the neighbors' optimal feature to boost the performance of downstream tasks. Based on the local augmentation, we further design a novel framework: LA-GNN, which can apply to any GNN models in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments and analyses show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement for various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Soughing0823/LAGNN.  
11,,Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. We maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN.  
12,,Interpreting deep neural networks from the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) perspective has inspired many efficient and robust network architectures. However, existing ODE based approaches ignore the relationship among data points, which is a critical component in many problems including few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning. In this paper, inspired by the diffusive ODEs, we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet) to strengthen the interactions among data points. Under the structured data assumption, it is proved that the diffusion mechanism can decrease the distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points and reduces the distance among local intra-class points. This property can be easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable hyperplanes. The synthetic binary classification experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion mechanism. Moreover, extensive experiments of few-shot image classification and semi-supervised graph node classification in various datasets validate the advantages of the proposed Diff-ResNet over existing few-shot learning methods.  
13,,The success of machine learning stems from its structured data representation. Similar data have close representation as compressed codes for classification or emerged labels for clustering. We observe that the frequency of the internal representation follows power laws in both supervised and unsupervised learning. The scale-invariant distribution implies that machine learning largely compresses frequent typical data, and at the same time, differentiates many atypical data as outliers. In this study, we derive how the power laws can naturally arise in machine learning. In terms of information theory, the scale-invariant representation corresponds to a maximally uncertain data grouping among possible representations that guarantee pre-specified learning accuracy.  
14,,Sensitive medical data is often subject to strict usage constraints. In this paper, we trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) on real-world electronic health records (EHR). It was then used to create a data-set of "fake" patients through synthetic data generation (SDG) to circumvent usage constraints. This real-world data was tabular, binary, intensive care unit (ICU) patient diagnosis data. The entire data-set was split into separate data silos to mimic real-world scenarios where multiple ICU units across different hospitals may have similarly structured data-sets within their own organisations but do not have access to each other's data-sets. We implemented federated learning (FL) to train separate GANs locally at each organisation, using their unique data silo and then combining the GANs into a single central GAN, without any siloed data ever being exposed. This global, central GAN was then used to generate the synthetic patients data-set. We performed an evaluation of these synthetic patients with statistical measures and through a structured review by a group of medical professionals. It was shown that there was no significant reduction in the quality of the synthetic EHR when we moved between training a single central model and training on separate data silos with individual models before combining them into a central model. This was true for both the statistical evaluation (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0154 for single-source vs. RMSE of 0.0169 for dual-source federated) and also for the medical professionals' evaluation (no quality difference between EHR generated from a single source and EHR generated from multiple sources).  
15,,Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this paper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with matching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.  
16,,Graph feature extraction is a fundamental task in graphs analytics. Using feature vectors (graph descriptors) in tandem with data mining algorithms that operate on Euclidean data, one can solve problems such as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection on graph-structured data. This idea has proved fruitful in the past, with spectral-based graph descriptors providing state-of-the-art classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, these algorithms do not scale to large graphs since: 1) they require storing the entire graph in memory, and 2) the end-user has no control over the algorithm's runtime. In this paper, we present single-pass streaming algorithms to approximate structural features of graphs (counts of subgraphs of order $k \geq 4$). Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid keeping the entire graph in memory, and controlling the sample size enables us to control the time taken by the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our descriptors by analyzing the approximation error, classification accuracy, and scalability to massive graphs. Our experiments showcase the effect of the sample size on approximation error and predictive accuracy. The proposed descriptors are applicable on graphs with millions of edges within minutes and outperform the state-of-the-art descriptors in classification accuracy.  
17,,Networks are ubiquitous in the real world such as social networks and communication networks, and anomaly detection on networks aims at finding nodes whose structural or attributed patterns deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. However, most of the traditional anomaly detection methods neglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore cannot effectively generalize to the graph structure data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based Autoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which considers both the structure and attribute for attributed networks. Specifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure space and attribute space respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning mechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the structure and attribute perspectives respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint learning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the structure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature decoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected by measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in the latent structure space and attribute space respectively. Extensive experiments on the real-world attributed networks show that Dual-SVDAE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
18,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great power in modeling graph structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may make biased predictions w.r.t protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color and gender. This is because the training data often contains historical bias towards sensitive attributes. In addition, we empirically show that the discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. As a result, the applications of GNNs in high-stake domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited. Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on i.i.d data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Generally, learning fair models require abundant sensitive attributes to regularize the model. However, for many graphs such as social networks, users are reluctant to share sensitive attributes. Thus, only limited sensitive attributes are available for fair GNN training in practice. Moreover, directly collecting and applying the sensitive attributes in fair model training may cause privacy issues, because the sensitive information can be leaked in data breach or attacks on the trained model. Therefore, we study a novel and crucial problem of learning fair GNNs with limited and private sensitive attribute information. In an attempt to address these problems, FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. We further extend FairGNN to NT-FairGNN which can achieve both fairness and privacy on sensitive attributes by using limited and private sensitive attributes. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN and NT-FairGNN in achieving fair and high-accurate classification.  
19,,Learning distributions over graph-structured data is a challenging task with many applications in biology and chemistry. In this work we use an energy-based model (EBM) based on multi-channel graph neural networks (GNN) to learn permutation invariant unnormalized density functions on graphs. Unlike standard EBM training methods our approach is to learn the model via minimizing adversarial stein discrepancy. Samples from the model can be obtained via Langevin dynamics based MCMC. We find that this approach achieves competitive results on graph generation compared to benchmark models.  
20,,UMAP is a non-parametric graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm using applied Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology to find low-dimensional embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and (2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we extend the second step of UMAP to a parametric optimization over neural network weights, learning a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We first demonstrate that Parametric UMAP performs comparably to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then explore UMAP as a regularization, constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, parametrically varying global structure preservation, and improving classifier accuracy for semi-supervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.

21,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize the deep neural networks to graph-structured data, have achieved great success in modeling graphs. However, as an extension of deep learning for graphs, GNNs lack explainability, which largely limits their adoption in scenarios that demand the transparency of models. Though many efforts are taken to improve the explainability of deep learning, they mainly focus on i.i.d data, which cannot be directly applied to explain the predictions of GNNs because GNNs utilize both node features and graph topology to make predictions. There are only very few work on the explainability of GNNs and they focus on post-hoc explanations. Since post-hoc explanations are not directly obtained from the GNNs, they can be biased and misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of self-explainable GNNs which can simultaneously give predictions and explanations. We propose a new framework which can find $K$-nearest labeled nodes for each unlabeled node to give explainable node classification, where nearest labeled nodes are found by interpretable similarity module in terms of both node similarity and local structure similarity. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for explainable node classification.  
22,,Representation learning on static graph-structured data has shown a significant impact on many real-world applications. However, less attention has been paid to the evolving nature of temporal networks, in which the edges are often changing over time. The embeddings of such temporal networks should encode both graph-structured information and the temporally evolving pattern. Existing approaches in learning temporally evolving network representations fail to capture the temporal interdependence. In this paper, we propose Toffee, a novel approach for temporal network representation learning based on tensor decomposition. Our method exploits the tensor-tensor product operator to encode the cross-time information, so that the periodic changes in the evolving networks can be captured. Experimental results demonstrate that Toffee outperforms existing methods on multiple real-world temporal networks in generating effective embeddings for the link prediction tasks.  
23,,Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder will only own either the node features or edge information), different data holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon>5$). Our studies will shed light on future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models; in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.  
24,,Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of dynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19 spread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of spatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions. One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints, an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal accuracy with substantially fewer instances.  
25,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been popularly used in analyzing graph-structured data, showing promising results in various applications such as node classification, link prediction and network recommendation. In this paper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for attributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components: attention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention component introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate better non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional implementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not only node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs that merely consider node features. The aggregation component uses a residual connection to generate the final embedding. We evaluate the performance of GIPA using the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (ogbn-proteins for short) dataset. The experimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average test ROC-AUC of $0.8700\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the ogbn-proteins leaderboard.  
26,,Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial part of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels. This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer, we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and EPHOIE datasets.  
27,,One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to trigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary; input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic -- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA. We further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss potential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.  
28,,Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in the task of semantically segmenting images. Applying the same methods on 3D data still poses challenges due to the heavy memory requirements and the lack of structured data. Here, we propose LatticeNet, a novel approach for 3D semantic segmentation, which takes raw point clouds as input. A PointNet describes the local geometry which we embed into a sparse permutohedral lattice. The lattice allows for fast convolutions while keeping a low memory footprint. Further, we introduce DeformSlice, a novel learned data-dependent interpolation for projecting lattice features back onto the point cloud. We present results of 3D segmentation on multiple datasets where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also extend and evaluate our network for instance and dynamic object segmentation.  
29,,Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) on the graph with real-life applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN) for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution. Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may not generalize to QAP.  
30,,Deep learning's performance has been extensively recognized recently. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to deal with graph-structural data that classical deep learning does not easily manage. Since most GNNs were created using distinct theories, direct comparisons are impossible. Prior research has primarily concentrated on categorizing existing models, with little attention paid to their intrinsic connections. The purpose of this study is to establish a unified framework that integrates GNNs based on spectral graph and approximation theory. The framework incorporates a strong integration between spatial- and spectral-based GNNs while tightly associating approaches that exist within each respective domain.  
31,,Decision forests (Forests), in particular random forests and gradient boosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured, so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices. However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks (ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions. In all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF) algorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and challenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains interpretability and theoretical justification.  
32,,Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings) across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations. It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a cluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of DGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.  
33,,Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, are useful tools for improving the data efficiency of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. However, recent deep learning models have moved forward from independent and identically distributed data to graph-structured data, such as social networks, e-commerce user-item graphs, and knowledge graphs. This evolution has led to the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that go beyond the models existing data selection methods are designed for. Therefore, we present Grain, an efficient framework that opens up a new perspective through connecting data selection in GNNs with social influence maximization. By exploiting the common patterns of GNNs, Grain introduces a novel feature propagation concept, a diversified influence maximization objective with novel influence and diversity functions, and a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee into a unified framework. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that Grain significantly improves both the performance and efficiency of data selection (including active learning and core-set selection) for GNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to bridge two largely parallel threads of research, data selection, and social influence maximization, in the setting of GNNs, paving new ways for improving data efficiency.  
34,,The geometric structure of an optimization landscape is argued to be fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning. A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data, stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization. Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class, in the sense that these weight spaces are well-connected without any hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical mechanics insight about why deep learning is unreasonably effective in terms of the high-dimensional weight space, and how deep networks are different from shallow ones.  
35,,Despite the remarkable success of deep learning, optimal convolution operation on point cloud remains indefinite due to its irregular data structure. In this paper, we present Cubic Kernel Convolution (CKConv) that learns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous and discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D cubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in embedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the voxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is forced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this way, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided features, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer from discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space. Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA), to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and hence produce representative features. By learning feature voxelization with LSA, CKConv can extract enriched features for effective point cloud analysis. We show that CKConv has great applicability to point cloud processing tasks including object classification, object part segmentation, and scene semantic segmentation with state-of-the-art results.  
36,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exploded onto the machine learning scene in recent years owing to their capability to model and learn from graph-structured data. Such an ability has strong implications in a wide variety of fields whose data is inherently relational, for which conventional neural networks do not perform well. Indeed, as recent reviews can attest, research in the area of GNNs has grown rapidly and has lead to the development of a variety of GNN algorithm variants as well as to the exploration of groundbreaking applications in chemistry, neurology, electronics, or communication networks, among others. At the current stage of research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is still an open challenge for several reasons. Besides of their novelty, GNNs are hard to compute due to their dependence on the input graph, their combination of dense and very sparse operations, or the need to scale to huge graphs in some applications. In this context, this paper aims to make two main contributions. On the one hand, a review of the field of GNNs is presented from the perspective of computing. This includes a brief tutorial on the GNN fundamentals, an overview of the evolution of the field in the last decade, and a summary of operations carried out in the multiple phases of different GNN algorithm variants. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of current software and hardware acceleration schemes is provided, from which a hardware-software, graph-aware, and communication-centric vision for GNN accelerators is distilled.  
37,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success as a framework for deep learning on graph-structured data. However, GNNs are fundamentally limited by their tree-structured inductive bias: the WL-subtree kernel formulation bounds the representational capacity of GNNs, and polynomial-time GNNs are provably incapable of recognizing triangles in a graph. In this work, we propose to augment the GNN message-passing operations with information defined on ego graphs (i.e., the induced subgraph surrounding each node). We term these approaches Ego-GNNs and show that Ego-GNNs are provably more powerful than standard message-passing GNNs. In particular, we show that Ego-GNNs are capable of recognizing closed triangles, which is essential given the prominence of transitivity in real-world graphs. We also motivate our approach from the perspective of graph signal processing as a form of multiplex graph convolution. Experimental results on node classification using synthetic and real data highlight the achievable performance gains using this approach.  
38,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) is widely used to learn a powerful representation of graph-structured data. Recent work demonstrates that transferring knowledge from self-supervised tasks to downstream tasks could further improve graph representation. However, there is an inherent gap between self-supervised tasks and downstream tasks in terms of optimization objective and training data. Conventional pre-training methods may be not effective enough on knowledge transfer since they do not make any adaptation for downstream tasks. To solve such problems, we propose a new transfer learning paradigm on GNNs which could effectively leverage self-supervised tasks as auxiliary tasks to help the target task. Our methods would adaptively select and combine different auxiliary tasks with the target task in the fine-tuning stage. We design an adaptive auxiliary loss weighting model to learn the weights of auxiliary tasks by quantifying the consistency between auxiliary tasks and the target task. In addition, we learn the weighting model through meta-learning. Our methods can be applied to various transfer learning approaches, it performs well not only in multi-task learning but also in pre-training and fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively combine auxiliary tasks with the target task and significantly improve the performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.  
39,,Graph representation learning plays a vital role in processing graph-structured data. However, prior arts on graph representation learning heavily rely on labeling information. To overcome this problem, inspired by the recent success of graph contrastive learning and Siamese networks in visual representation learning, we propose a novel self-supervised approach in this paper to learn node representations by enhancing Siamese self-distillation with multi-scale contrastive learning. Specifically, we first generate two augmented views from the input graph based on local and global perspectives. Then, we employ two objectives called cross-view and cross-network contrastiveness to maximize the agreement between node representations across different views and networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform empirical experiments on five real-world datasets. Our method not only achieves new state-of-the-art results but also surpasses some semi-supervised counterparts by large margins. Code is made available at https://github.com/GRAND-Lab/MERIT  
40,,Recent achievements in end-to-end deep learning have encouraged the exploration of tasks dealing with highly structured data with unified deep network models. Having such models for compressing audio signals has been challenging since it requires discrete representations that are not easy to train with end-to-end backpropagation. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that combines recurrent neural networks (RNNs) within the training strategy of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with a binary representation of the latent space. We apply a reparametrization trick for the Bernoulli distribution for the discrete representations, which allows smooth backpropagation. In addition, our approach allows the separation of the encoder and decoder, which is necessary for compression tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first end-to-end learning for a single audio compression model with RNNs, and our model achieves a Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 20.54.  
41,,Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.  
42,,Multi-relational graph is a ubiquitous and important data structure, allowing flexible representation of multiple types of interactions and relations between entities. Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the most important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge completion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a larger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires predicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different graphs (inter-domain link prediction). However, this poses a real challenge to existing methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between entities of the same graph only (intra-domain link prediction). In this study, we propose a new approach to tackle the inter-domain link prediction problem by softly aligning the entity distributions between different domains with optimal transport and maximum mean discrepancy regularizers. Experiments on real-world datasets show that optimal transport regularizer is beneficial and considerably improves the performance of baseline methods.  
43,,Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently, whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph. Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error, while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results compared with the existing state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on seven datasets.  
44,,Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces, more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration. Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup, where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be significant in large-scale applications.  
45,,Relational databases are the de facto standard for storing and querying structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore, the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.   In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively. Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable predictions for data-driven decision making.  
46,,We propose a model for hierarchical structured data as an extension to the stochastic temporal convolutional network. The proposed model combines an autoregressive model with a hierarchical variational autoencoder and downsampling to achieve superior computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed model on two different types of sequential data: speech and handwritten text. The results are promising with the proposed model achieving state-of-the-art performance.  
47,,Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message passing.  
48,,In the world where big data reigns and there is plenty of hardware prepared to gather a huge amount of non structured data, data acquisition is no longer a problem. Surveillance cameras are ubiquitous and they capture huge numbers of people walking across different scenes. However, extracting value from this data is challenging, specially for tasks that involve human images, such as face recognition and person re-identification. Annotation of this kind of data is a challenging and expensive task. In this work we propose a domain adaptation workflow to allow CNNs that were trained in one domain to be applied to another domain without the need for new annotation of the target data. Our method uses AlignedReID++ as the baseline, trained using a Triplet loss with batch hard. Domain adaptation is done by using pseudo-labels generated using an unsupervised learning strategy. Our results show that domain adaptation techniques really improve the performance of the CNN when applied in the target domain.  
49,,In representation learning on the graph-structured data, under heterophily (or low homophily), many popular GNNs may fail to capture long-range dependencies, which leads to their performance degradation. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we propose a graph convolutional networks with structure learning (GCN-SL), and furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied to node classification. The proposed GCN-SL contains two improvements: corresponding to node features and edges, respectively. In the aspect of node features, we propose an efficient-spectral-clustering (ESC) and an ESC with anchors (ESC-ANCH) algorithms to efficiently aggregate feature representations from all similar nodes. In the aspect of edges, we build a re-connected adjacency matrix by using a special data preprocessing technique and similarity learning, and the re-connected adjacency matrix can be optimized directly along with GCN-SL parameters. Considering that the original adjacency matrix may provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs being with a low level of homophily. The proposed GCN-SL can aggregate feature representations from nearby nodes via re-connected adjacency matrix and is applied to graphs with various levels of homophily. Experimental results on a wide range of benchmark datasets illustrate that the proposed GCN-SL outperforms the stateof-the-art GNN counterparts.  
50,,Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to be in general aligned with previous "best practices" observed from handcrafted tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route output features through different projection heads corresponding to different augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on augmentation selection. We release the code at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated.  
51,,Data augmentation is a key element of deep learning pipelines, as it informs the network during training about transformations of the input data that keep the label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular, while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as neuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be suitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be necessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange does. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through class-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the class largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free optimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes intractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use differentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG signals are a perfect example of data for which good augmentation policies are mostly unknown. In this work, we demonstrate the relevance of our approach on the clinically relevant sleep staging classification task, for which we also propose differentiable transformations.  
52,,Temporal graph signals are multivariate time series with individual components associated with nodes of a fixed graph structure. Data of this kind arises in many domains including activity of social network users, sensor network readings over time, and time course gene expression within the interaction network of a model organism. Traditional matrix decomposition methods applied to such data fall short of exploiting structural regularities encoded in the underlying graph and also in the temporal patterns of the signal. How can we take into account such structure to obtain a succinct and interpretable representation of temporal graph signals?   We propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal decomposition (TGSD). The key idea is to learn a low-rank, joint encoding of the data via a combination of graph and time dictionaries. We propose a highly scalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing values, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank estimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5 million data points and produces the most parsimonious models. To the best of our knowledge, TGSD is the first framework to jointly model graph signals by temporal and graph dictionaries.  
53,,We introduce the Graph Mixture Density Networks, a new family of machine learning models that can fit multimodal output distributions conditioned on graphs of arbitrary topology. By combining ideas from mixture models and graph representation learning, we address a broader class of challenging conditional density estimation problems that rely on structured data. In this respect, we evaluate our method on a new benchmark application that leverages random graphs for stochastic epidemic simulations. We show a significant improvement in the likelihood of epidemic outcomes when taking into account both multimodality and structure. The empirical analysis is complemented by two real-world regression tasks showing the effectiveness of our approach in modeling the output prediction uncertainty. Graph Mixture Density Networks open appealing research opportunities in the study of structure-dependent phenomena that exhibit non-trivial conditional output distributions.  
54,,Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.  
55,,Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other three models.  
56,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used for mining graph-structured data with impressive performance. However, traditional GNNs suffer from over-smoothing, non-robustness and over-fitting problems. To solve these weaknesses, we design a novel GNN solution, namely Graph Attention Network with LSTM-based Path Reweighting (PR-GAT). PR-GAT can automatically aggregate multi-hop information, highlight important paths and filter out noises. In addition, we utilize random path sampling in PR-GAT for data augmentation. The augmented data is used for predicting the distribution of corresponding labels. Finally, we demonstrate that PR-GAT can mitigate the issues of over-smoothing, non-robustness and overfitting. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 5 out of 7 datasets and competitive accuracy for other 2 datasets. The average accuracy of 7 datasets have been improved by 0.5\% than the best SOTA from literature.  
57,,This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks based on framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for graph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass frequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a framelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces a graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and high-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the graph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage activation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression: noises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately cutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the signal can be compressed to less than half its original size with well-preserved prediction performance.  
58,,The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.  
59,,Graphs are versatile tools for representing structured data. As a result, a variety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis. Although many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences between input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the computational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several benchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML identifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.  
60,,An outlier is an observation or a data point that is far from rest of the data points in a given dataset or we can be said that an outlier is away from the center of mass of observations. Presence of outliers can skew statistical measures and data distributions which can lead to misleading representation of the underlying data and relationships. It is seen that the removal of outliers from the training dataset before modeling can give better predictions. With the advancement of machine learning, the outlier detection models are also advancing at a good pace. The goal of this work is to highlight and compare some of the existing outlier detection techniques for the data scientists to use that information for outlier algorithm selection while building a machine learning model.  
61,,The spatio-temporal graph learning is becoming an increasingly important object of graph study. Many application domains involve highly dynamic graphs where temporal information is crucial, e.g. traffic networks and financial transaction graphs. Despite the constant progress made on learning structured data, there is still a lack of effective means to extract dynamic complex features from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models such as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs simultaneously. To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale architecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series modeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in spacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in spatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the original structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals within graph sequences. Experiments on spatio-temporal prediction tasks demonstrate that our model effectively captures comprehensive features in multiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods on several real-world datasets.  
62,,The Wasserstein distance provides a notion of dissimilarities between probability measures, which has recent applications in learning of structured data with varying size such as images and text documents. In this work, we analyze the $k$-nearest neighbor classifier ($k$-NN) under the Wasserstein distance and establish the universal consistency on families of distributions. Using previous known results on the consistency of the $k$-NN classifier on infinite dimensional metric spaces, it suffices to show that the families is a countable union of finite dimension sets. As a result, we show that the $k$-NN classifier is universally consistent on spaces of finitely supported measures, the space of Gaussian measures, and the space of measures with finite wavelet densities. In addition, we give a counterexample to show that the universal consistency does not hold on $\mathcal{W}_p((0,1))$.  
63,,Recent years have witnessed tremendous interest in deep learning on graph-structured data. Due to the high cost of collecting labeled graph-structured data, domain adaptation is important to supervised graph learning tasks with limited samples. However, current graph domain adaptation methods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the properties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the observed social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the different crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the background noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first assume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three independent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the domain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this assumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation method for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph auto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three supervised learning modules. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets in the graph classification task reveal that our method not only significantly outperforms the traditional domain adaptation methods and the disentangled-based domain adaptation methods but also outperforms the state-of-the-art graph domain adaptation algorithms.  
64,,While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node and graph representation learning in many applications, the neighborhood aggregation scheme exposes additional vulnerabilities to adversaries seeking to extract node-level information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of protecting sensitive attributes by information obfuscation when learning with graph structured data. We propose a framework to locally filter out pre-determined sensitive attributes via adversarial training with the total variation and the Wasserstein distance. Our method creates a strong defense against inference attacks, while only suffering small loss in task performance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our framework against a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off between maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments across multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum chemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense across various graph structures and tasks, while producing competitive GNN encoders for downstream tasks.  
65,,Link prediction is an important learning task for graph-structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel topological approach to characterize interactions between two nodes. Our topological feature, based on the extended persistent homology, encodes rich structural information regarding the multi-hop paths connecting nodes. Based on this feature, we propose a graph neural network method that outperforms state-of-the-arts on different benchmarks. As another contribution, we propose a novel algorithm to more efficiently compute the extended persistence diagrams for graphs. This algorithm can be generally applied to accelerate many other topological methods for graph learning tasks.  
66,,Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing. The data in these tasks is typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high dimensional features and interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several classical paradigms of GNNs structures (e.g., graph convolutional networks) are summarized, and key applications in power systems, such as fault scenario application, time series prediction, power flow calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Furthermore, main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in power systems are discussed.  
67,,HyperGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph structured data. However, most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-ange relations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-in-play module for improving the representational power of HGCNNs. Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship between hypernodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.  
68,,Supervised machine learning has several drawbacks that make it difficult to use in many situations. Drawbacks include: heavy reliance on massive training data, limited generalizability and poor expressiveness of high-level semantics. Low-shot Learning attempts to address these drawbacks. Low-shot learning allows the model to obtain good predictive power with very little or no training data, where structured knowledge plays a key role as a high-level semantic representation of human. This article will review the fundamental factors of low-shot learning technologies, with a focus on the operation of structured knowledge under different low-shot conditions. We also introduce other techniques relevant to low-shot learning. Finally, we point out the limitations of low-shot learning, the prospects and gaps of industrial applications, and future research directions.  
69,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/seongjunyun/Graph_Transformer_Networks  
70,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the most popular approaches to using deep learning on graph-structured data, and they have shown state-of-the-art performances on a variety of tasks. However, according to a recent study, a careful choice of pooling functions, which are used for the aggregation or readout operation in GNNs, is crucial for enabling GNNs to extrapolate. Without the ideal combination of pooling functions, which varies across tasks, GNNs completely fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, while the number of possible combinations grows exponentially with the number of layers. In this paper, we present GNP, a $L^p$ norm-like pooling function that is trainable end-to-end for any given task. Notably, GNP generalizes most of the widely-used pooling functions. We verify experimentally that simply replacing all pooling functions with GNP enables GNNs to extrapolate well on many node-level, graph-level, and set-related tasks; and GNP sometimes performs even better than optimal combinations of existing pooling functions.  
71,,HyperGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNNs) have demonstrated their potential in modeling high-order relations preserved in graph structured data. However, most existing convolution filters are localized and determined by the pre-defined initial hypergraph topology, neglecting to explore implicit and long-ange relations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose the first learning-based method tailored for constructing adaptive hypergraph structure, termed HypERgrAph Laplacian aDaptor (HERALD), which serves as a generic plug-in-play module for improving the representational power of HGCNNs. Specifically, HERALD adaptively optimizes the adjacency relationship between hypernodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on various popular hypergraph datasets for node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our approach obtains consistent and considerable performance enhancement, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability.  
72,,Graph is an usual representation of relational data, which are ubiquitous in manydomains such as molecules, biological and social networks. A popular approach to learningwith graph structured data is to make use of graph kernels, which measure the similaritybetween graphs and are plugged into a kernel machine such as a support vector machine.Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) based graph kernels, which employ WL labeling scheme to extract subtree patterns and perform node embedding, are demonstrated to achieve great performance while being efficiently computable. However, one of the main drawbacks of ageneral kernel is the decoupling of kernel construction and learning process. For moleculargraphs, usual kernels such as WL subtree, based on substructures of the molecules, consider all available substructures having the same importance, which might not be suitable inpractice. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the weights of subtree patterns in the framework of WWL kernels, the state of the art method for graph classification task [14]. To overcome the computational issue on large scale data sets, we present an efficient learning algorithm and also derive a generalization gap bound to show its convergence. Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for learning the weights of subtree patterns.  
73,,Event forecasting is a challenging, yet important task, as humans seek to constantly plan for the future. Existing automated forecasting studies rely mostly on structured data, such as time-series or event-based knowledge graphs, to help predict future events. In this work, we aim to formulate a task, construct a dataset, and provide benchmarks for developing methods for event forecasting with large volumes of unstructured text data. To simulate the forecasting scenario on temporal news documents, we formulate the problem as a restricted-domain, multiple-choice, question-answering (QA) task. Unlike existing QA tasks, our task limits accessible information, and thus a model has to make a forecasting judgement. To showcase the usefulness of this task formulation, we introduce ForecastQA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 10,392 event forecasting questions, which have been collected and verified via crowdsourcing efforts. We present our experiments on ForecastQA using BERT-based models and find that our best model achieves 60.1% accuracy on the dataset, which still lags behind human performance by about 19%. We hope ForecastQA will support future research efforts in bridging this gap.  
74,,Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with non-Euclidean structural data. Both spatial-based and spectral-based GNNs are relying on adjacency matrix to guide message passing among neighbors during feature aggregation. Recent works have mainly focused on powerful message passing modules, however, in this paper, we show that none of the message passing modules is necessary. Instead, we propose a pure multilayer-perceptron-based framework, Graph-MLP with the supervision signal leveraging graph structure, which is sufficient for learning discriminative node representation. In model-level, Graph-MLP only includes multi-layer perceptrons, activation function, and layer normalization. In the loss level, we design a neighboring contrastive (NContrast) loss to bridge the gap between GNNs and MLPs by utilizing the adjacency information implicitly. This design allows our model to be lighter and more robust when facing large-scale graph data and corrupted adjacency information. Extensive experiments prove that even without adjacency information in testing phase, our framework can still reach comparable and even superior performance against the state-of-the-art models in the graph node classification task.  
75,,Various classes of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been proposed and shown to be successful in a wide range of applications with graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework able to compare the expressive power of these GNN architectures. The current universality theorems only apply to intractable classes of GNNs. Here, we prove the first approximation guarantees for practical GNNs, paving the way for a better understanding of their generalization. Our theoretical results are proved for invariant GNNs computing a graph embedding (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the output) and equivariant GNNs computing an embedding of the nodes (permutation of the input permutes the output). We show that Folklore Graph Neural Networks (FGNN), which are tensor based GNNs augmented with matrix multiplication are the most expressive architectures proposed so far for a given tensor order. We illustrate our results on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (a NP-Hard combinatorial problem) by showing that FGNNs are able to learn how to solve the problem, leading to much better average performances than existing algorithms (based on spectral, SDP or other GNNs architectures). On a practical side, we also implement masked tensors to handle batches of graphs of varying sizes.  
76,,This paper presents Gem, a model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for any GNNs on various graph learning tasks. Specifically, we formulate the problem of providing explanations for the decisions of GNNs as a causal learning task. Then we train a causal explanation model equipped with a loss function based on Granger causality. Different from existing explainers for GNNs, Gem explains GNNs on graph-structured data from a causal perspective. It has better generalization ability as it has no requirements on the internal structure of the GNNs or prior knowledge on the graph learning tasks. In addition, Gem, once trained, can be used to explain the target GNN very quickly. Our theoretical analysis shows that several recent explainers fall into a unified framework of additive feature attribution methods. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that Gem achieves a relative increase of the explanation accuracy by up to $30\%$ and speeds up the explanation process by up to $110\times$ as compared to its state-of-the-art alternatives.  
77,,Learning the representation of data with hierarchical structures in the hyperbolic space attracts increasing attention in recent years. Due to the constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the hyperbolic embedding models significantly.  
78,,Imbalanced classification on graphs is ubiquitous yet challenging in many real-world applications, such as fraudulent node detection. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on many network analysis tasks. However, most existing GNNs have almost exclusively focused on the balanced networks, and would get unappealing performance on the imbalanced networks. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative adversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced classification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph structure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority class nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure distribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the number of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph convolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between real nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes and majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world imbalanced network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method ImGAGN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for semi-supervised imbalanced node classification task.  
79,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the first choice methods for graph machine learning problems thanks to their ability to learn state-of-the-art level representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to user-side privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated Learning is the de-facto standard for collaborative training of machine learning models over many distributed edge devices without the need for centralization. Nevertheless, training graph neural networks in a federated setting is vaguely defined and brings statistical and systems challenges. This work proposes SpreadGNN, a novel multi-task federated training framework capable of operating in the presence of partial labels and absence of a central server for the first time in the literature. SpreadGNN extends federated multi-task learning to realistic serverless settings for GNNs, and utilizes a novel optimization algorithm with a convergence guarantee, Decentralized Periodic Averaging SGD (DPA-SGD), to solve decentralized multi-task learning problems. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a variety of non-I.I.D. distributed graph-level molecular property prediction datasets with partial labels. Our results show that SpreadGNN outperforms GNN models trained over a central server-dependent federated learning system, even in constrained topologies. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/FedML-AI/SpreadGNN  
80,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used deep learning models that learn meaningful representations from graph-structured data. Due to the finite nature of the underlying recurrent structure, current GNN methods may struggle to capture long-range dependencies in underlying graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a graph learning framework, called Implicit Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), where predictions are based on the solution of a fixed-point equilibrium equation involving implicitly defined "state" vectors. We use the Perron-Frobenius theory to derive sufficient conditions that ensure well-posedness of the framework. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we derive a tractable projected gradient descent method to train the framework. Experiments on a comprehensive range of tasks show that IGNNs consistently capture long-range dependencies and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models.  
81,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully employed in a myriad of applications involving graph-structured data. Theoretical findings establish that GNNs use nonlinear activation functions to create low-eigenvalue frequency content that can be processed in a stable manner by subsequent graph convolutional filters. However, the exact shape of the frequency content created by nonlinear functions is not known, and thus, it cannot be learned nor controlled. In this work, node-variant graph filters (NVGFs) are shown to be capable of creating frequency content and are thus used in lieu of nonlinear activation functions. This results in a novel GNN architecture that, although linear, is capable of creating frequency content as well. Furthermore, this new frequency content can be either designed or learned from data. In this way, the role of frequency creation is separated from the nonlinear nature of traditional GNNs. Extensive simulations are carried out to differentiate the contributions of frequency creation from those of the nonlinearity.  
82,,Networks are ubiquitous in the real world. Link prediction, as one of the key problems for network-structured data, aims to predict whether there exists a link between two nodes. The traditional approaches are based on the explicit similarity computation between the compact node representation by embedding each node into a low-dimensional space. In order to efficiently handle the intensive similarity computation in link prediction, the hashing technique has been successfully used to produce the node representation in the Hamming space. However, the hashing-based link prediction algorithms face accuracy loss from the randomized hashing techniques or inefficiency from the learning to hash techniques in the embedding process. Currently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework has been widely applied to the graph-related tasks in an end-to-end manner, but it commonly requires substantial computational resources and memory costs due to massive parameter learning, which makes the GNN-based algorithms impractical without the help of a powerful workhorse. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective model called #GNN, which balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. #GNN is able to efficiently acquire node representation in the Hamming space for link prediction by exploiting the randomized hashing technique to implement message passing and capture high-order proximity in the GNN framework. Furthermore, we characterize the discriminative power of #GNN in probability. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed #GNN algorithm achieves accuracy comparable to the learning-based algorithms and outperforms the randomized algorithm, while running significantly faster than the learning-based algorithms. Also, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability on a large-scale network with the limited resources.  
83,,Estimating the amount of electricity that can be produced by rooftop photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches. Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a rooftop.  
84,,Functional connectivity (FC) between regions of the brain can be assessed by the degree of temporal correlation measured with functional neuroimaging modalities. Based on the fact that these connectivities build a network, graph-based approaches for analyzing the brain connectome have provided insights into the functions of the human brain. The development of graph neural networks (GNNs) capable of learning representation from graph structured data has led to increased interest in learning the graph representation of the brain connectome. Although recent attempts to apply GNN to the FC network have shown promising results, there is still a common limitation that they usually do not incorporate the dynamic characteristics of the FC network which fluctuates over time. In addition, a few studies that have attempted to use dynamic FC as an input for the GNN reported a reduction in performance compared to static FC methods, and did not provide temporal explainability. Here, we propose STAGIN, a method for learning dynamic graph representation of the brain connectome with spatio-temporal attention. Specifically, a temporal sequence of brain graphs is input to the STAGIN to obtain the dynamic graph representation, while novel READOUT functions and the Transformer encoder provide spatial and temporal explainability with attention, respectively. Experiments on the HCP-Rest and the HCP-Task datasets demonstrate exceptional performance of our proposed method. Analysis of the spatio-temporal attention also provide concurrent interpretation with the neuroscientific knowledge, which further validates our method. Code is available at https://github.com/egyptdj/stagin  
85,,Kernel methods on discrete domains have shown great promise for many challenging data types, for instance, biological sequence data and molecular structure data. Scalable kernel methods like Support Vector Machines may offer good predictive performances but do not intrinsically provide uncertainty estimates. In contrast, probabilistic kernel methods like Gaussian Processes offer uncertainty estimates in addition to good predictive performance but fall short in terms of scalability. While the scalability of Gaussian processes can be improved using sparse inducing point approximations, the selection of these inducing points remains challenging. We explore different techniques for selecting inducing points on discrete domains, including greedy selection, determinantal point processes, and simulated annealing. We find that simulated annealing, which can select inducing points that are not in the training set, can perform competitively with support vector machines and full Gaussian processes on synthetic data, as well as on challenging real-world DNA sequence data.  
86,,This paper presents Sparse Tensor Classifier (STC), a supervised classification algorithm for categorical data inspired by the notion of superposition of states in quantum physics. By regarding an observation as a superposition of features, we introduce the concept of wave-particle duality in machine learning and propose a generalized framework that unifies the classical and the quantum probability. We show that STC possesses a wide range of desirable properties not available in most other machine learning methods but it is at the same time exceptionally easy to comprehend and use. Empirical evaluation of STC on structured data and text classification demonstrates that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both standard classifiers and deep learning, at the additional benefit of requiring minimal data pre-processing and hyper-parameter tuning. Moreover, STC provides a native explanation of its predictions both for single instances and for each target label globally.  
87,,Over the last few years, we have seen increasing data generated from non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular, there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial convolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically generated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining relations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple architectures with a low number of filters.  
88,,Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in dealing with data of non-Euclidean structures. Their success directly attributes to fitting graph structures effectively to data such as in social media and knowledge databases. For image processing applications, the use of graph structures and GCNs have not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder network with added graph convolutions by converting feature maps to vertexes of a pre-generated graph to synthetically construct graph-structured data. By doing this, we inexplicitly apply graph Laplacian regularization to the feature maps, making them more structured. The experiments show that it significantly boosts performance for image restoration tasks, including deblurring and super-resolution. We believe it opens up opportunities for GCN-based approaches in more applications.  
89,,Traditional approaches for data anonymization consider relational data and textual data independently. We propose rx-anon, an anonymization approach for heterogeneous semi-structured documents composed of relational and textual attributes. We map sensitive terms extracted from the text to the structured data. This allows us to use concepts like k-anonymity to generate a joined, privacy-preserved version of the heterogeneous data input. We introduce the concept of redundant sensitive information to consistently anonymize the heterogeneous data. To control the influence of anonymization over unstructured textual data versus structured data attributes, we introduce a modified, parameterized Mondrian algorithm. The parameter $\lambda$ allows to give different weight on the relational and textual attributes during the anonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets using a Normalized Certainty Penalty score, adapted to the problem of jointly anonymizing relational and textual data. The results show that our approach is capable of reducing information loss by using the tuning parameter to control the Mondrian partitioning while guaranteeing k-anonymity for relational attributes as well as for sensitive terms. As rx-anon is a framework approach, it can be reused and extended by other anonymization algorithms, privacy models, and textual similarity metrics.  
90,,We propose an approach to learning with graph-structured data in the problem domain of graph classification. In particular, we present a novel type of readout operation to aggregate node features into a graph-level representation. To this end, we leverage persistent homology computed via a real-valued, learnable, filter function. We establish the theoretical foundation for differentiating through the persistent homology computation. Empirically, we show that this type of readout operation compares favorably to previous techniques, especially when the graph connectivity structure is informative for the learning problem.  
91,,We study the multiple manifold problem, a binary classification task modeled on applications in machine vision, in which a deep fully-connected neural network is trained to separate two low-dimensional submanifolds of the unit sphere. We provide an analysis of the one-dimensional case, proving for a simple manifold configuration that when the network depth $L$ is large relative to certain geometric and statistical properties of the data, the network width $n$ grows as a sufficiently large polynomial in $L$, and the number of i.i.d. samples from the manifolds is polynomial in $L$, randomly-initialized gradient descent rapidly learns to classify the two manifolds perfectly with high probability. Our analysis demonstrates concrete benefits of depth and width in the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized network and its gradients. The argument centers around the neural tangent kernel and its role in the nonasymptotic analysis of training overparameterized neural networks; to this literature, we contribute essentially optimal rates of concentration for the neural tangent kernel of deep fully-connected networks, requiring width $n \gtrsim L\,\mathrm{poly}(d_0)$ to achieve uniform concentration of the initial kernel over a $d_0$-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n_0-1}$, and a nonasymptotic framework for establishing generalization of networks trained in the NTK regime with structured data. The proof makes heavy use of martingale concentration to optimally treat statistical dependencies across layers of the initial random network. This approach should be of use in establishing similar results for other network architectures.  
92,,In this paper, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework called VoxelContext-Net for both static and dynamic point cloud compression. Taking advantages of both octree based methods and voxel based schemes, our approach employs the voxel context to compress the octree structured data. Specifically, we first extract the local voxel representation that encodes the spatial neighbouring context information for each node in the constructed octree. Then, in the entropy coding stage, we propose a voxel context based deep entropy model to compress the symbols of non-leaf nodes in a lossless way. Furthermore, for dynamic point cloud compression, we additionally introduce the local voxel representations from the temporal neighbouring point clouds to exploit temporal dependency. More importantly, to alleviate the distortion from the octree construction procedure, we propose a voxel context based 3D coordinate refinement method to produce more accurate reconstructed point cloud at the decoder side, which is applicable to both static and dynamic point cloud compression. The comprehensive experiments on both static and dynamic point cloud benchmark datasets(e.g., ScanNet and Semantic KITTI) clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed method VoxelContext-Net for 3D point cloud geometry compression.  
93,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in learning graph-structured data and various tasks. However, many current GNNs suffer from three common problems when facing large-size graphs or using a deeper structure: neighbors explosion, node dependence, and oversmoothing. Such problems attribute to the data structures of the graph itself or the designing of the multi-layers GNNs framework, and can lead to low training efficiency and high space complexity. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a general subgraph-based training framework, namely Ripple Walk Training (RWT), for deep and large graph neural networks. RWT samples subgraphs from the full graph to constitute a mini-batch, and the full GNN is updated based on the mini-batch gradient. We analyze the high-quality subgraphs to train GNNs in a theoretical way. A novel sampling method Ripple Walk Sampler works for sampling these high-quality subgraphs to constitute the mini-batch, which considers both the randomness and connectivity of the graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on different sizes of graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RWT in training various GNNs (GCN & GAT).  
94,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the standard method for numerous tasks on graph-structured data such as node classification. However, real-world graphs are often evolving over time and even new classes may arise. We model these challenges as an instance of lifelong learning, in which a learner faces a sequence of tasks and may take over knowledge acquired in past tasks. Such knowledge may be stored explicitly as historic data or implicitly within model parameters. In this work, we systematically analyze the influence of implicit and explicit knowledge. Therefore, we present an incremental training method for lifelong learning on graphs and introduce a new measure based on $k$-neighborhood time differences to address variances in the historic data. We apply our training method to five representative GNN architectures and evaluate them on three new lifelong node classification datasets. Our results show that no more than 50% of the GNN's receptive field is necessary to retain at least 95% accuracy compared to training over the complete history of the graph data. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that implicit knowledge becomes more important when fewer explicit knowledge is available. 
95,,\textit{Graph Neural Network} (GNN) is a promising approach for analyzing graph-structured data that tactfully captures their dependency information via node-level message passing. It has achieved state-of-the-art performances in many tasks, such as node classification, graph matching, clustering, and graph generation. As GNNs operate on non-Euclidean data, their irregular data access patterns cause considerable computational costs and overhead on conventional architectures, such as GPU and CPU. Our analysis shows that GNN adopts a hybrid computing model. The \textit{Aggregation} (or \textit{Message Passing}) phase performs vector additions where vectors are fetched with irregular strides. The \textit{Transformation} (or \textit{Node Embedding}) phase can be either dense or sparse-dense matrix multiplication. In this work, We propose \textit{VersaGNN}, an ultra-efficient, systolic-array-based versatile hardware accelerator that unifies dense and sparse matrix multiplication. By applying this single optimized systolic array to both aggregation and transformation phases, we have significantly reduced chip sizes and energy consumption. We then divide the computing engine into blocked systolic arrays to support the \textit{Strassen}'s algorithm for dense matrix multiplication, dramatically scaling down the number of multiplications and enabling high-throughput computation of GNNs. To balance the workload of sparse-dense matrix multiplication, we also introduced a greedy algorithm to combine sparse sub-matrices of compressed format into condensed ones to reduce computational cycles. Compared with current state-of-the-art GNN software frameworks, \textit{VersaGNN} achieves on average 3712$\times$ speedup with 1301.25$\times$ energy reduction on CPU, and 35.4$\times$ speedup with 17.66$\times$ energy reduction on GPU.  
96,,Graph neural networks are a popular variant of neural networks that work with graph-structured data. In this work, we consider combining graph neural networks with the energy-based view of Grathwohl et al. (2019) with the aim of obtaining a more robust classifier. We successfully implement this framework by proposing a novel method to ensure generation over features as well as the adjacency matrix and evaluate our method against the standard graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture (Kipf & Welling (2016)). Our approach obtains comparable discriminative performance while improving robustness, opening promising new directions for future research for energy-based graph neural networks.  
97,,Network-structured data becomes ubiquitous in daily life and is growing at a rapid pace. It presents great challenges to feature engineering due to the high non-linearity and sparsity of the data. The local and global structure of the real-world networks can be reflected by dynamical transfer behaviors among nodes. This paper proposes a network embedding framework to capture the transfer behaviors on structured networks via deep prediction models. We first design a degree-weight biased random walk model to capture the transfer behaviors on the network. Then a deep network embedding method is introduced to preserve the transfer possibilities among the nodes. A network structure embedding layer is added into conventional deep prediction models, including Long Short-Term Memory Network and Recurrent Neural Network, to utilize the sequence prediction ability. To keep the local network neighborhood, we further perform a Laplacian supervised space optimization on the embedding feature representations. Experimental studies are conducted on various datasets including social networks, citation networks, biomedical network, collaboration network and language network. The results show that the learned representations can be effectively used as features in a variety of tasks, such as clustering, visualization, classification, reconstruction and link prediction, and achieve promising performance compared with state-of-the-arts.  
98,,Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive Deep Neural Network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes. This paper presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching. VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video inference process across nodes. The paper proposes a novel content-driven micro-batch resizing, queryaware caching and micro-batch based utility filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive evaluations are performed over five real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves ~2.3X higher throughput with minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds.  
99,,Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging deep learning model class, can extract meaningful representations from highly expressive graph-structured data and are therefore gaining popularity for wider ranges of applications. However, current GNNs suffer from the poor performance of their sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) operator, even when using powerful GPUs. Our analysis shows that 95% of the inference time could be spent on SpMM when running popular GNN models on NVIDIA's advanced V100 GPU. Such SpMM performance bottleneck hinders GNNs' applicability to large-scale problems or the development of more sophisticated GNN models. To address this inference time bottleneck, we introduce ES-SpMM, a cache-first edge sampling mechanism and codesigned SpMM kernel. ES-SpMM uses edge sampling to downsize the graph to fit into GPU's shared memory. It thus reduces the computation cost and improves SpMM's cache locality. To evaluate ES-SpMM's performance, we integrated it with a popular GNN framework, DGL, and tested it using representative GNN models and datasets. Our results show that ES-SpMM outperforms the highly optimized cuSPARSE SpMM kernel by up to 4.35x with no accuracy loss and by 45.3x with less than a 1% accuracy loss.  
100,,Tensor networks are a powerful modeling framework developed for computational many-body physics, which have only recently been applied within machine learning. In this work we utilize a uniform matrix product state (u-MPS) model for probabilistic modeling of sequence data. We first show that u-MPS enable sequence-level parallelism, with length-n sequences able to be evaluated in depth O(log n). We then introduce a novel generative algorithm giving trained u-MPS the ability to efficiently sample from a wide variety of conditional distributions, each one defined by a regular expression. Special cases of this algorithm correspond to autoregressive and fill-in-the-blank sampling, but more complex regular expressions permit the generation of richly structured data in a manner that has no direct analogue in neural generative models. Experiments on sequence modeling with synthetic and real text data show u-MPS outperforming a variety of baselines and effectively generalizing their predictions in the presence of limited data.  
101,,Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for global optimization of expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is not completely black-box. The data may have some known structure, e.g. symmetries, and the data generation process can yield useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and struggle to incorporate known structure or auxiliary information. Instead, we propose performing BO on complex, structured problems by using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of scalable surrogate models that have the representation power and flexibility to handle structured data and exploit auxiliary information. We demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry, including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that BNNs often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both sampling efficiency and computational cost.  
102,,The mean shift (MS) algorithm is a nonparametric method used to cluster sample points and find the local modes of kernel density estimates, using an idea based on iterative gradient ascent. In this paper we develop a mean-shift-inspired algorithm to estimate the modes of regression functions and partition the sample points in the input space. We prove convergence of the sequences generated by the algorithm and derive the non-asymptotic rates of convergence of the estimated local modes for the underlying regression model. We also demonstrate the utility of the algorithm for data-enabled discovery through an application on biomolecular structure data. An extension to subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) algorithm used to extract ridges of regression functions is briefly discussed.  
103,,Recently, there has been great success in applying deep neural networks on graph structured data. Most work, however, focuses on either node- or graph-level supervised learning, such as node, link or graph classification or node-level unsupervised learning (e.g. node clustering). Despite its wide range of possible applications, graph-level unsupervised learning has not received much attention yet. This might be mainly attributed to the high representation complexity of graphs, which can be represented by n! equivalent adjacency matrices, where n is the number of nodes. In this work we address this issue by proposing a permutation-invariant variational autoencoder for graph structured data. Our proposed model indirectly learns to match the node ordering of input and output graph, without imposing a particular node ordering or performing expensive graph matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on various graph reconstruction and generation tasks and evaluate the expressive power of extracted representations for downstream graph-level classification and regression.  
104,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied in many structured data domains, with applications ranging from molecular property prediction to the analysis of social networks. Motivated by the broad applicability of GNNs, we propose the family of so-called RankGNNs, a combination of neural Learning to Rank (LtR) methods and GNNs. RankGNNs are trained with a set of pair-wise preferences between graphs, suggesting that one of them is preferred over the other. One practical application of this problem is drug screening, where an expert wants to find the most promising molecules in a large collection of drug candidates. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed pair-wise RankGNN approach either significantly outperforms or at least matches the ranking performance of the naive point-wise baseline approach, in which the LtR problem is solved via GNN-based graph regression.  
105,,Graph neural networks (GNN) have been proven to be mature enough for handling graph-structured data on node-level graph representation learning tasks. However, the graph pooling technique for learning expressive graph-level representation is critical yet still challenging. Existing pooling methods either struggle to capture the local substructure or fail to effectively utilize high-order dependency, thus diminishing the expression capability. In this paper we propose HAP, a hierarchical graph-level representation learning framework, which is adaptively sensitive to graph structures, i.e., HAP clusters local substructures incorporating with high-order dependencies. HAP utilizes a novel cross-level attention mechanism MOA to naturally focus more on close neighborhood while effectively capture higher-order dependency that may contain crucial information. It also learns a global graph content GCont that extracts the graph pattern properties to make the pre- and post-coarsening graph content maintain stable, thus providing global guidance in graph coarsening. This novel innovation also facilitates generalization across graphs with the same form of features. Extensive experiments on fourteen datasets show that HAP significantly outperforms twelve popular graph pooling methods on graph classification task with an maximum accuracy improvement of 22.79%, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art graph matching and graph similarity learning algorithms by over 3.5% and 16.7%.  
106,,In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted in the representation learning of graph-structured data and provided state-of-the-art performance in various applications such as link prediction, node classification, and recommendation. Motivated by recent advances of self-supervision for representation learning in natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised learning has been recently studied to leverage unlabeled graph-structured data. However, employing self-supervision tasks as auxiliary tasks to assist a primary task has been less explored in the literature on graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning framework to effectively learn graph neural networks. Moreover, this work is the first study showing that a meta-path prediction is beneficial as a self-supervised auxiliary task for heterogeneous graphs. Our method is learning to learn a primary task with various auxiliary tasks to improve generalization performance. The proposed method identifies an effective combination of auxiliary tasks and automatically balances them to improve the primary task. Our methods can be applied to any graph neural network in a plug-in manner without manual labeling or additional data. Also, it can be extended to any other auxiliary tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the performance of node classification and link prediction.  
107,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved to be an effective representation learning framework for graph-structured data, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many practical predictive tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. Among the variants of GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) learn to assign dense attention coefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve the performance of many graph learning tasks. However, real-world graphs are often very large and noisy, and GATs are prone to overfitting if not regularized properly. Even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of GATs may fail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide more noise than useful information for feature aggregation. In this paper, we propose Sparse Graph Attention Networks (SGATs) that learn sparse attention coefficients under an $L_0$-norm regularization, and the learned sparse attentions are then used for all GNN layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified graph. By doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus perform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SGATs. In particular, SGATs can remove about 50\%-80\% edges from large assortative graphs, while retaining similar classification accuracies. On disassortative graphs, SGATs prune majority of noisy edges and outperform GATs in classification accuracies by significant margins. Furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph learning algorithm that shows significant redundancies in graphs and edge-sparsified graphs can achieve similar or sometimes higher predictive performances than original graphs.  
108,,Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.  
109,,Deep learning has recently demonstrated its promising performance for vision-based parking-slot detection. However, very few existing methods explicitly take into account learning the link information of the marking-points, resulting in complex post-processing and erroneous detection. In this paper, we propose an attentional graph neural network based parking-slot detection method, which refers the marking-points in an around-view image as graph-structured data and utilize graph neural network to aggregate the neighboring information between marking-points. Without any manually designed post-processing, the proposed method is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments have been conducted on public benchmark dataset, where the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Jiaolong/gcn-parking-slot}.  
110,,Generalizable, transferrable, and robust representation learning on graph-structured data remains a challenge for current graph neural networks (GNNs). Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of parameterized graph augmentation extents and patterns, and observe further performance gains in preliminary experiments. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL.  
111,,Generative modeling of set-structured data, such as point clouds, requires reasoning over local and global structures at various scales. However, adopting multi-scale frameworks for ordinary sequential data to a set-structured data is nontrivial as it should be invariant to the permutation of its elements. In this paper, we propose SetVAE, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for sets. Motivated by recent progress in set encoding, we build SetVAE upon attentive modules that first partition the set and project the partition back to the original cardinality. Exploiting this module, our hierarchical VAE learns latent variables at multiple scales, capturing coarse-to-fine dependency of the set elements while achieving permutation invariance. We evaluate our model on point cloud generation task and achieve competitive performance to the prior arts with substantially smaller model capacity. We qualitatively demonstrate that our model generalizes to unseen set sizes and learns interesting subset relations without supervision. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jw9730/setvae.  
112,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) draw their strength from explicitly modeling the topological information of structured data. However, existing GNNs suffer from limited capability in capturing the hierarchical graph representation which plays an important role in graph classification. In this paper, we innovatively propose hierarchical graph capsule network (HGCN) that can jointly learn node embeddings and extract graph hierarchies. Specifically, disentangled graph capsules are established by identifying heterogeneous factors underlying each node, such that their instantiation parameters represent different properties of the same entity. To learn the hierarchical representation, HGCN characterizes the part-whole relationship between lower-level capsules (part) and higher-level capsules (whole) by explicitly considering the structure information among the parts. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HGCN and the contribution of each component.  
113,,Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted increasing attention due to its successful applications on various graph-structure data. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial attacks are threatening the functionality of GNNs. Although numerous works have been proposed to defend adversarial attacks from various perspectives, most of them can be robust against the attacks only on specific scenarios. To address this shortage of robust generalization, we propose to defend the adversarial attacks on GNN through applying the Spatio-Temporal sparsification (called ST-Sparse) on the GNN hidden node representation. ST-Sparse is similar to the Dropout regularization in spirit. Through intensive experiment evaluation with GCN as the target GNN model, we identify the benefits of ST-Sparse as follows: (1) ST-Sparse shows the defense performance improvement in most cases, as it can effectively increase the robust accuracy by up to 6\% improvement; (2) ST-Sparse illustrates its robust generalization capability by integrating with the existing defense methods, similar to the integration of Dropout into various deep learning models as a standard regularization technique; (3) ST-Sparse also shows its ordinary generalization capability on clean datasets, in that ST-SparseGCN (the integration of ST-Sparse and the original GCN) even outperform the original GCN, while the other three representative defense methods are inferior to the original GCN.  
114,,Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality. Accurately monitoring HF progress and adjust therapies are critical for improving patient outcomes. An experienced cardiologist can make accurate HF stage diagnoses based on combination of symptoms, signs, and lab results from the electronic health records (EHR) of a patient, without directly measuring heart function. We examined whether machine learning models, more specifically the XGBoost model, can accurately predict patient stage based on EHR, and we further applied the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to identify informative features and their interpretations. Our results indicate that based on structured data from EHR, our models could predict patients' ejection fraction (EF) scores with moderate accuracy. SHAP analyses identified informative features and revealed potential clinical subtypes of HF. Our findings provide insights on how to design computing systems to accurately monitor disease progression of HF patients through continuously mining patients' EHR data.  
115,,The emergence of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has greatly boosted the progress of graph learning. However, two disturbing factors, noise and redundancy in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results, impede further development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive yet compressed subgraph to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the interpretable part of the graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the information bottleneck (IB) principle, which is less studied on graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by the IB principle, we propose a novel subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) framework to recognize such subgraphs, named IB-subgraph. However, the intractability of mutual information and the discrete nature of graph data makes the objective of SIB notoriously hard to optimize. To this end, we introduce a bilevel optimization scheme coupled with a mutual information estimator for irregular graphs. Moreover, we propose a continuous relaxation for subgraph selection with a connectivity loss for stabilization. We further theoretically prove the error bound of our estimation scheme for mutual information and the noise-invariant nature of IB-subgraph. Extensive experiments on graph learning and large-scale point cloud tasks demonstrate the superior property of IB-subgraph.  
116,,Random forests on the one hand, and neural networks on the other hand, have met great success in the machine learning community for their predictive performance. Combinations of both have been proposed in the literature, notably leading to the so-called deep forests (DF) (Zhou \& Feng,2019). In this paper, our aim is not to benchmark DF performances but to investigate instead their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, DF architecture can be generally simplified into more simple and computationally efficient shallow forest networks. Despite some instability, the latter may outperform standard predictive tree-based methods. We exhibit a theoretical framework in which a shallow tree network is shown to enhance the performance of classical decision trees. In such a setting, we provide tight theoretical lower and upper bounds on its excess risk. These theoretical results show the interest of tree-network architectures for well-structured data provided that the first layer, acting as a data encoder, is rich enough.  
117,,Graph-structured data are ubiquitous. However, graphs encode diverse types of information and thus play different roles in data representation. In this paper, we distinguish the \textit{representational} and the \textit{correlational} roles played by the graphs in node-level prediction tasks, and we investigate how Graph Neural Network (GNN) models can effectively leverage both types of information. Conceptually, the representational information provides guidance for the model to construct better node features; while the correlational information indicates the correlation between node outcomes conditional on node features. Through a simulation study, we find that many popular GNN models are incapable of effectively utilizing the correlational information. By leveraging the idea of the copula, a principled way to describe the dependence among multivariate random variables, we offer a general solution. The proposed Copula Graph Neural Network (CopulaGNN) can take a wide range of GNN models as base models and utilize both representational and correlational information stored in the graphs. Experimental results on two types of regression tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
118,,Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have received much attention recently, owing to their capability in handling graph-structured data. Among the existing GCNNs, many methods can be viewed as instances of a neural message passing motif; features of nodes are passed around their neighbors, aggregated and transformed to produce better nodes' representations. Nevertheless, these methods seldom use node transition probabilities, a measure that has been found useful in exploring graphs. Furthermore, when the transition probabilities are used, their transition direction is often improperly considered in the feature aggregation step, resulting in an inefficient weighting scheme. In addition, although a great number of GCNN models with increasing level of complexity have been introduced, the GCNNs often suffer from over-fitting when being trained on small graphs. Another issue of the GCNNs is over-smoothing, which tends to make nodes' representations indistinguishable. This work presents a new method to improve the message passing process based on node transition probabilities by properly considering the transition direction, leading to a better weighting scheme in nodes' features aggregation compared to the existing counterpart. Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method termed DropNode to address the over-fitting and over-smoothing issues simultaneously. DropNode randomly discards part of a graph, thus it creates multiple deformed versions of the graph, leading to data augmentation regularization effect. Additionally, DropNode lessens the connectivity of the graph, mitigating the effect of over-smoothing in deep GCNNs. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with the state of the art.  
119,,Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of tasks due to their ability to model non-uniform structured data. Despite their promise, there exists little research exploring methods to make them more efficient at inference time. In this work, we explore the viability of training quantized GNNs, enabling the usage of low precision integer arithmetic during inference. We identify the sources of error that uniquely arise when attempting to quantize GNNs, and propose an architecturally-agnostic method, Degree-Quant, to improve performance over existing quantization-aware training baselines commonly used on other architectures, such as CNNs. We validate our method on six datasets and show, unlike previous attempts, that models generalize to unseen graphs. Models trained with Degree-Quant for INT8 quantization perform as well as FP32 models in most cases; for INT4 models, we obtain up to 26% gains over the baselines. Our work enables up to 4.7x speedups on CPU when using INT8 arithmetic.  
120,,In this thesis, we develop various techniques for working with sets in machine learning. Each input or output is not an image or a sequence, but a set: an unordered collection of multiple objects, each object described by a feature vector. Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks.   The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations (sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many experiments.   The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output). Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some extremely simple datasets. To avoid this problem, we develop two models that properly take the structure of sets into account. Various experiments show that our set prediction techniques can significantly benefit over existing approaches.
1,,"We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value."
2,,"check-in:my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than 5 minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room:we had the 2 bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge TWICE before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the 4 of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the 4 days we were there. Ended up doing the laundry by hand. location:central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. 7eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast:small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa:we had massage and Chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average."
3,,"The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals."
4,,"Excellent room with own computer, great location close to sights, breakfast not great, service okay."
5,,This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean.
6,,"Beijing was my last stop on a three-week trip to China. I stayed at far East for 6 nights and would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. After staying in a variety of places, Far East seemed adequate, although a bit pricey for the private rooms based on my other experiences. I chose the hotel for its location, which was convenient - near the subway and Tian'anmen (10-15 walk to each). The hostel is located in a hutong, which I really enjoyed seeing. I'm surprised that I saw several comments here about people not feeling safe in the area and being grossed out - hello, it's a fairly poor neighborhood in a developing country. I never had any issues or felt threatened in any way, and there are people still out selling fruit late at night so it's not at all desolate, plus there are several other hostels located nearby. The hotel istelf is fine - nothing fancy, with rather grim communist decor, but cleaned well every day. One negative is that no cab drivers knew where the hotel was, even with the Chinese map. When I arrived, the cabdriver had a difficult timetrying to drive through the narrow streets which were blocked by a bunch of bikes parked in the way. I ended up just getting dropped off on the main drag and walking into the hutong since it was less bother and probably quicker."
7,,"The Beijing Friendship Hotel was well-priced (in part due to our getting the &quot;conference rate&quot; because my husband was attending an international jurisprudence conference) and clean. The staff was personable and helpful and the room-service food was stellar (if you like tofu and some serious spice, try the &quot;bean curd with chile paste&quot;--fantastic!). The hotel was a bit outside the city core, but the surrounds were pretty, the included breakfast was very good, and it was an overall nice stay. Only thing that could use improvement: the beds. Extremely hard."
8,,"I have never felt so deceived &amp; ripped off by a hotel, and that is saying a lot having spent 7 months in China...We called the hotel reservations hotline directly a week before our arrival and was told by a so-called 'Sales Manager' that our 2 night stay in a standard room would come to RMB$1288. When we arrived at the hotel the person who checked us in told us that our stay would amount to RMB$1488 including breakfast (which we did not request) and spent 10 minutes arguing about before he agreed to change the price back to RMB$1288. He then told us that double beds were not avaliable in standard rooms, and that we would have to pay an extra RMB$200 for a double bed - so we ended up sleeping in a room with 2 single beds with no breakfast.We were put on a non-smoking floor, but the whole place smelt like burnt old carpet. The room &amp; bathroom were reasonable sizes, but there was no facial tissues avaliable and they gave us rough, cheap toilet paper - not what you would expect for a 5 star hotel. The room had a balcony which looks onto Chang An Avenue, but you cannot turn off the balcony light and the curtains inside the room don't close properly, so you've got a light shining in your face for the whole night.Friends advised us that most hotels can organise day trips to the Great Wall at reasonable prices (most of our friends paid ~RMB$600-$700 for a taxi to take them there, wait and take them back to their hotels), but when we went to ask the concierge about this, they insisted we hire a driver &amp; personal guide for RMB$700 PER PERSON. They refused to book a taxi for us, claiming that taxis were not trustworthly. We ended up asking the concierge at the Raffles Beijing Hotel next door to organise a taxi for us.The final insult was when we checked out of the hotel - We were told to pay RMB$2576 instead of the agreed RMB$1288, as they then claimed that RMB$1288 was the PER NIGHT rate, not the total cost of the stay. The front desk manager claimed that there was no way possible that their Sales Manager would offer the rooms for less that RMB$1000 per night as it was a 5 star hotel etc etc. We got on a 3rd party hotel booking website (ctrip) and showed him the Beijing hotel was only listed at RMB$607 per night (+ 15% service charge), but he did not relent - changing his story and claimed that we were 'upgraded' (which we were not told and did not agree to at check in - and if this was true, I dread to think what a 'standard room' would actually be like) and that it was not possible for him to only charge us RMB$1288 for 2 nights.We ended up moving to the Courtyard Marriot 1 block away - their RACK RATE was only RMB$850 pn + 15%. We probably could have gotten an even better price if we booked ahead of time, but we were just glad to be out of the Beijing Hotel."
9,,"Many Western tourists use this hotel, but really you could find somewhere better for the price. The decor is uninspiring and the furniture was a little grubby, though they are redecorating so that will change. Breakfast was not included in the roomprice and was then extortionate ($160 RMB) . Staff were extremely unhelpful over arranging for our business requests: things kept being against the rules. The lifts use a key system, so that non-residents can't access the rooms. This is clearly good for security but it is a nuisance if you are trying to hold a meeting. I suppose the one good thing for Western tourists is that the staff speak very good English. Also, it looks from the map as if you might like to stay here - it is in the middle of the city, but actually it is the most dreadful location for seeing anything of real life or finding a good restaurant etc, and it is immediately next to the main railway station which is quite an unsafe place."
10,,Excellent budget hotel with all the facilities that you need. In walking distance for shopping and most of the major sights.Would recommend to anyone.
11,,"Compared to hotel chains Sihe has its own personality: beautiful courtyard, nice rooms equipped with the finest furniture. You can spend your time reading in the very peculiar garden, finding peace and armony. If you are willing to pay for this... Probably suitable for families with children who needs rest and space. We spent our days walking a lot so we didn't take advantage of these amenities.Located in a typical hutong, we always felt safe, no problem with taxi driver.Near to the famous Wangfujing street, within a walking distance to the underground (5-8 minutes).Staff is fantastic: helpful in sorting out every kind of problem, satisfactory level of english.Only one downside: the breakfast was quite poor."
12,,"After the Beijing Olympics we stayed in this beautiful hotel, which we had found on-line. We soon noticed that it was brand new with a few growing pains but a spectacular property with accommodating and helpful staff, beautifully appointed rooms and gorgeous bathrooms! At first we were uncertain about the location because it seemed quieter than anywhere else we had stayed in Beijing but soon learned that the neighbourhood was classy, young and had much to offer."
13,,"This is a very nice hotel. The location is fantastic. Walking distance to Tienneman Square, walking street just off the Square, Forbidden City and the famous Peking Duck restaurant. The rooms are very nice, with a nice large bathtub which came in very handy after climbing the Great Wall. The beds are incredibly uncomfortable. It is like sleeping directly on the box spring with a thin mattress pad on it. The food in the hotel is not very good and it is incredibly expensive. Skip the Italian Restaurant on the 20th floor. The food was terrible and way over priced. We didn't see many other food options close by other than the duck restaurant. The staff is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. For the most part, we had no trouble communicating as most of the staff spoke fair English."
14,,"I have stayed at other &quot; high-end&quot; hotels in Beijing -but this was my first experience with China World. It is a really nice hotel -but you better like &quot; Big-ness&quot; as it is really, really large. I was somewhat confused after arriving in my room as the hotel information made it clear the the hotel has its own water purification system -yet the person who checked me in and escorted me to my room made it clear to only drink bottled water ( which you really ought to make the practice anywhere in Beijing anyway)After a long flight ( 14 hrs) - I was ready to grab a bite and crash - so I went to the &quot;Cafe&quot; restaurant. Informal and adequate -but there were a bunch of little kids running around and playing at the buffet, picking up food, rolling on the floor - basically being unwatched &quot;kids &quot; - the restaurant staff gave them the evil eye but made no attempt to tell the parents who were seated at a large table in the corner - to go make them behave. It was really a pain and other partons were obviously upset. A five star hotel would have addressed the issue.The room was great -lots of international TV channels - staff very polite but it was a little surprising to find that some could not speak English - case &amp; point. One evening I wanted to go to the &quot;Gourmet Corner&quot; -a place advertised on their web site as well as the in-room info. This is a great place to grab a good sandwich and go back to your room. Problem was that in order to make myself clear ( the desk could not direct me to it &amp; even claimed there was no such place) - I went back to my room, got the hotel book, went back down had &quot;pointed&quot; to the information - then the light shown and a very polite staffer escorted me ( out the building, across the street and to the shop) - OK - no big deal - but 5 Stars -Really?I took my staff to the Arie restaurant one evening -really quite nice -good service and the food was really very good -but it was not truly outstanding - which is what I had hoped for. Price is really not too bad however -so as they say - you get what you pay for.Westerners should be especially cautious just outside the hotel. Almost every time I walked off-property - I would hear &quot; Excuse me sir - I am student -can you talk to me?' - Well DON'T -they're hookers...just ignore and keep walking. This is not the hotel's fault -just a note of caution. There is great shopping - an entire mall is down the escalator -Starbucks etc -good location and most helpful staff. I wouldn't give it 5 stars -4 or 4+ maybe."
15,,"My Chinese friend and I booked a two bedroom apartment with a double bed and two single beds.Upon arrival we were given an apartment with four single beds only. We complained to reception, who told us they didn't actually have any apartments with double beds. When we pressed them further, they admitted that they do have such apartments but had given them to other people (despite our booking). The carpet, beds and bathrooms were also in decidedly shabby condition, so we wanted out.Reception told us we could cancel without charge, but we thought it best to confirm this with the hotel site we had booked through.Various phone calls followed as we spoke to the customer service line for the site, who in turn spoke to the hotel, who in turn spoke to us. Meanwhile we also rang some places to find a different hotel in the same area. Eventually we found one, made a booking, and were relieved we wouldn't have to stay in a shabby place with the wrong bed configuration.But then came the snare. Our complaints and phone calls had, apparently, taken just over one hour, and the City Hotel informed us that, although we had not yet used anything in the apartment (not even the toilets), it was their &quot;policy&quot; that we would have to pay the first night's accommodation, because we had been in the room for more than one hour. They were willing, however, to &quot;negotiate&quot; this down to 100 yuan.Right...so we spend one hour trying to sort out THEIR failure to honour our booking, and they want to charge US for it? I've never heard of anything so shonky in my life. It was only through some very heated discussion and raised voices down at reception that were were eventually able to get back our deposit and leave without charge.Does anyone really want to stay at a shabby hotel with a management that fails to honour people's bookings and then tries to charge them for the hotel's own mistakes? Shonky, shonky, shonky."
16,,"This 'hotel' is a property with over 40 houses designed by the leading Asian architects. Fantastic. Villas can be rented as a whole or by room. We stayed in the Bamboo House 2, which is straight out of Architectural Digest. The room was very comfortable with nice amenities. TV was small but you are there for the Great Wall and the environs and not there for TV (with the prices paid, at least). Internet is free and fairly fast. There is a gym if the weather is inclement; the gym is updated and small. Walking around the compound is good enough exercise; the hotel has access to a private unrestored part of the Great Wall. You will need to climb up a path (about 20 minutes) to the section of the Wall. Amazing. ... The restaurants were very good; Chinese food was excellent (catering a little more to Western flavors). Wines are extremely expensive; it was hard to find a glass of wine for less than US$20 so we settled for beer. Cost of food is also expensive, with entrees around at least US$20++. Maitre d' at the upstairs restaurant was exceptional. Not all staff were comfortable speaking English but can get by with the basics. Didn't use the spa because the prices were exorbitant. Overall a really worthwhile experience. It would make a nice day trip as well."
17,,"My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed in the Beijing Marriot Courtyard Hotel along with other family members and friends while visiting China. We found the hotel and its staff to be tremendously helpful and courteous at all times. the staff at the front desk handled all of our reservations very well, our rooms were very clean and comfortable, the facilities were comfortable and well located. The highlight of the hotel, however, is its quality of service particularly by the concierge. Davis was so very helpful with every question, problem, need, request, etc. at any time. He booked plane tickets, show tickets, hailed taxis, provided information and maps and generally provided a superior quality of service. to people new to china and to beijing in particular, his advice and quality of information was very helpful and much appreciated."
18,,"This hotel had a great location, but was not worth the high price. The 'deluxe' room we were given was small dark and basic furniture looked like it came from IKEA. We comlplained and were upgraded free to a suite. While this was more spacious and furniture a bit better, was badly planned and poorly lit, also had no twin beds and had to share bed with my sister, the alternative was to put another bed in the sitting area. Not what you would expect from the Crowne Plaza! It cost £7.00 for a gin and tonic, £4.50 for a cappuchino, we invited a friend fro breakfast and it cost £15.00! So think twice on a cost basis, add to this the 15% service charge and it makes everything very pricey. Good helpfull staff, hotel clean and comfortable, best beds ever!"
19,,"As funny as it might sound, one of my favorite things about this hotel was coming in the front doors and feeling the coolness and smelling the fresh, softly scented air in the hotel's lobby. It just felt so good to be staying there. The room was huge, including a huge bathroom. One of the best parts is that the room was SILENT. We were exhausted on this trip and were so grateful for quality sleep. The hotel's breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious, and was a great way to start our day. The whole hotel is very well appointed with quality, stylish materials. The staff was truly nice and helpful. I have to agree with other comments about taxis not knowing where this place is, though. Even with my Chinese friends speaking to the drivers, there always seemed to be a discussion about where the hotel is. That being said, we always go where we were going. HIGHLY recommended if you don't mind taking a cab to your destination."
20,,"This hotel is located directly at the new exhibition center (5 min walking).It's a newer hotel with many nice rooms and good breakfast.But this hotel is not normal crown standard. The service seams to be overstrained:1. We have made a reservation one week before. We also got a receipt by fax. But when we arrived at 10pm, after a long business day and travel, there was no room. It takes about 45min and long discussions to get a room. That's worse!2. For check out you need plenty of time. For us it takes about 40 minutes. The reason is, that this is a huge hotel, but they have more security staff than receptionist. There are only 3 receptionist at the desc and they are overextended. It takes about 20 minutes to get a bill.  I don't know why. They already have got a reservation with company name. They have my passport from check-in. But for checkout, they have to write everything in the computer (and very slowly).3. During breakfast it is better to get the coffee by your own, because there is less staff. Also you need some more table for the old dishes.The hotel is nice, but you need a lot of time for everything. I don't know why they have so view staff. They need more employees and better organisation/management.It's too expensive for so low standard."
21,,"Hotel room very spaceious and nice decor, clean and well maintained. there were few things I would like to point out. firstly, for some reason, every night from 7pm there was a terrible smell comes from the drain and we tried to close the bathroom door and light a candle but it doesn't help. Secondly, there never a spoon on the table to use, and every day we have to asked the waitress or waiter for spoon and it took more than 5 minutes for a spoon to arrived, some re-organising at the breakfast tables needed. It was stated that the hotel has its indoor heated swimming pool, but it was always freezing cold water, never heated. Steam room only steam for few minutes and have to wait for over 10 minutes for steam to come on, Sauna also freezing cold. They really need to have a better system for avoiding hair going into the drains at the shower at fitness centre, as it was a pool of dirty water at your feets while having a shower, not good at all."
22,,"This is definitely a great hotel. It is very luxurious, and the staff are there to cater for any whim at the drop of a hat. The rooms are large, the beds very comfortable, and the bathroom was really good too with plenty of room, complimentary bathrobes and slippers etc.The reason this hotel was so good in my view was the food. Fabulous buffet breakfast with everything and anything you could possible want. The restaurant in the evenings was also buffet, but very cleverly had 7 or 8 sections with food from different parts of the world, Italian, Indian, etc. so every palate was catered for, if for example you are not a lover of Chinese food. Overall, the hotel is excellent. The location was OK, but as we were on a guided trip the location was not an issue, as we were picked up and dropped off every day."
23,,"We stayed here for 6 nights and loved it. The area is wonderful and the hotel staff was so helpful. I am a graduate student on a budget and the price was right for me, but I felt like I was getting first-class treatment. One night, one staff member even walked us to the main street to flag us a taxi and make sure they understood where to take us. They all speak excellent English and the breakfast (costs extra) is yummy if you're interested in eating at the hotel."
24,,"Our tour accidently booked us in this hotel instead of the Days Inn Hotel and Suites on Hua Wei. On first entering the hotel, I was overwelmed with the smell of cigarette smoke. The lobby was drab and dirty. We were forced to spend one night here. We asked for a non smoking room and the desk person said we did have a non smoking room, but the room had an ash tray. The ventalation system was horrible and all night long we were stifled with cigarette smoke from other rooms. We opened the window. However, all night long metal workers were loading trucks under our window. We hardly slept at all. We were miserable. The staff was barely helpful when an alarm kept going off when we closed our door. Would never reccomend this hotel."
25,,Fantastic hotel that is managed by Hilton . Excellent breakfast ( I shared some pictures ).Kind and excellent staff . The pool water was cold in Autumn !! No body couldn't swim in that.Comfortable rooms and beds ( Really good beds ).Wireless internet in lobby.There is a big supermarket and a good CONFECTIONERY near hotel . Finding Muslim foods near the hotel is a hassle but you can buy vegetable pizza from Pappa Jonse restaurant. The nearest Subway station is not close to the hotel but you can walk to there and it takes about half an hour(ChangChun Jie station) or take a taxi to there. You can travel with 2 RMB to any station like Beijing Zoo.( There is a fantastic and cheap shopping center in front of Beijing zoo ( on top of Bus stations ) )I recommend Hilton hotels in Beijing to my friends.Sincerely
26,,"This hotel is absolutely fantastic!! Everything about it was good, especially the people! Everyone that works there is genuinely nice and helpful. The rooms are beautiful and have all the amenities you would wish for including an awesome shower head (actually, the shower has 2 shower heads so you can choose the one you prefer). The courtyard made me feel that i really am in China! Well, the room did too since it was furnished and decorated &quot;Chinese style&quot;. Enjoyed the breakfast very much and even my husband who doesn't eat pork had a decent selection. I could go on for a long time talking about this wonderful hotel but I'll keep it short and say &quot;Go there!! You will love it!&quot;I want to thank ALL the women and men that work there.. THEY made my trip!!"
27,,"I stayed at the Empark for the entire month of August while I was working at the Olympics. Upon arriving and through the entire stay, the staff was very attentive to my needs. The only issues I have is that the beds are extremely hard, free wireless is only available in the lobby - wired service is available in your room for a reasonable fee (hourly or by day) and laundry (which is done next door) is extremely expensive. Being in China I expected laundry service to be a lot cheaper than western hotels. In the basement of the hotel (floor B2) is a vegas-like mall. Restaurants, small boutiques, spas &amp; a gym/pool that is free for VIP guests of the hotel. I swam a few times at the pool and worked out at the gym. Although the hotel claims the gym is open 24hrs, it isn't staffed round the clock and it often appears closed. The Golden Resources Cafeteria in the hotel is a decent restaurant that offers a buffet for breakfast and dinner. My stay included breakfast and I was never disappointed. They offer a good selection of cereals, juices and fruits, as well as an assortment of hot entrees, breads &amp; sweet rolls. The coffee is good too! Taxis are fairly easy to come by at the hotel but keep in mind the hotel is located in the northwest part of the city and many of the historical attractions and shopping (Pearl &amp; Silk Market) are on the southeast part of town - expect a long cab ride. Fortunately taxi fares are inexpensive here.If you're coming to town for sightseeing, I think you would find this hotel too far out of the way (Summer Palace is the closest attraction)."
28,,"Fujian Hotel is one of the best hotel I stayed in China. I have stayed there several times each year for the last several year. The price is currently around RMB 580. The staff is excellent and willing to accomadate your need. The internet connection has been improved a lot and is very fast now. In comparison with other hotels at this price I stayed in Beijing and Shanghai, this is the best. The breakfast is mixed with Chinese and western styles and is very good. The location of this hotel is very convinient, next to the third highway circle, 20-30 min from airport and easy to go to anywhere in Beijing."
29,,"We stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China.Compared to the other hotels we stayed in this one was disappointing. Rooms ok but they didn't provide enough toilet paper or replace used shampoos. There was internet access in the bedrooms but it was very expensive. Carpets etc slighty stained . Wardrobe area small and only a couple of hangers. Some rooms had bath robes but ours didn't . We had requested a non smoking room and were given a room on the non smoking floor but it stank of smoke so we insisted on moving to another room.The buffet dinner in cafe style restaurant was very good value but breakfast was poor. Too small a restaurant for the number of rooms so it was a bit chaotic, no where to sit , no staff to clear tables and food running out . Gift shop sign said it opened at 7am so I had planned to buy a few last minute gifts on the morning we left but it didn't open on time and reception said it might be 10am before it opened . Drinks, coffees etc very expensive .It did have a leisure centre and indoor pool but it was compulsory to wear a swimming cap which they charged approx £3 each for ."
30,,"I haven't stayed in a 5* hotel before. Now i know. We were a familygroup of 9 people, age 6 month to 65 years. We stayed in this hotel for 6 days. We got a great prize on the internet via octopustravel.com. We came and were upgraded immediateley because we were staying for 6 days. That meant we got a view to the forbidden city. The rooms were spaciuos and clean and just great. Soft enough madrass. The staff were great and helpful. My sister has a daughter. She is 6 years old, and she cried because she got hungry at 1:00 am. My sister called for the staff in despair of what to do. The staff got some food for her and everything went alright at 1:00am, for free. Oh my god. Is it possible i thought. Never heard of this before. The hotel has a good location. Close to forbidden city, Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing street. 10 minutes to silkmarket with taxi. What i didn't like. Although my sister got a free meal for her daughter, the prize of drinks were expensive. More than in Norway where i come from. Maybe because it is a 5*hotel."
31,,"I was very impressed with the Grand Hyatt. It has an outstanding location on China Avenue close to a number of businesses. Tianamen square, Forbidden city and Silk market are all very close by. I was most impressed with the staff. I found every person I met and interacted with were friendly, and courteous. All had very strong English skills and were very helpful with all my questions. Morning buffet was a great way to start the day and had a great mix of Chinese and Western foods available. I requested a king bed and initially they couldn't accomodate when I checked in but the front desk staff were very helpful and put me in a larger suite room at the same rate. Not much pushing at all from my end.Only small down-side were the rooms which were a little dated (at least on the 6th floor, not sure where they might be on their renovations). Bed's very comfortable and bathrooms were quite nice so not a big negative, just felt a little old. Very clean and meticulous. Given the rates which were quite reasonable though, not sure I would want to pay more for the update.I would highly recommend this hotel."
32,,"I spent a week in the Xidan for a conference (also held in the hotel). Overall, my experience was quite good. The rooms are comfortable if not luxurious. The staff is very attentive, although the level of English varied from excellent to not-so-great. I could barely put out the &quot;please make up my room&quot; hanger before one of the cleaning staff would show up (within 10 minutes). Like many Beijing hotels, they warn you not to drink the water and to use the bottled water they provide. Some of my colleagues drank from the tap with no ill effect, but who knows. The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing, and I recommend renting a bike to get around to some of the nearby sites if you are willing to risk riding in the crazy traffic. My room came with complimentary breakfast buffet, which was really good and included comforting Western staples like eggs, bacon, and Frosted Flakes.I have two small quibbles: #1 It was WARM. Hot in the hotel room, and very hot in the basement conference rooms. The AC system seemed to be turned off. I spent most of the conference in a polo shirt becuase it was at least 80 degrees. My room was at least 78 or 80 degrees at night. I didn't sweat to death, but it was much warmer than I would have wanted -- and it was 60-70 degrees outside! The traffic noise was much too loud to open the window. #2 The internet service is verrrry slowwwwww. Fine for text e-mails but beyond that, prepare to wait and wait and eventually time out. It reminded me of the old days of dial-up access."
33,,"Stayed here and the Grand Hotel which are 2 5-star hotels and completely different. The GM has awesome facilities. One of the nicest pools/workout facilities i've ever seen in a hotel. Great great rooms and washrooms, free internet through flatscreen tv's with a wireless keyboard and a great breakfast. But the service was lame and inconsistent. The concierge seemed clueless and the checkin wasn't that friendly. Also they had no control over people butting in lines and checkin and checkout and the prices for tours and assitance was at least 200RMB more than the Grand Hotel (seems excessive for almost the exact same tours) Must commend the doormen however, they were really good.Also the location is in the CBD (right beside the CCTV building), so it ends up being a little bland. But if you're just worried about faciliities, this hotel was top notch."
34,,"Stayed 3 nights with a tour group. Was tour group standard. Rooms OK, Breakfast OK. Even though inside city moat, too far from anywhere.Ridiculously high prices in Hotel Bar (ie bottle of beer in bar was 15times local store price and 4 times local restaurant price)Also they wanted 1.8yuan PER MINUTE of internet access. Found local internet bar for 3yuan per hour."
35,,This hotel was filthy especially the carpets. I changed rooms 3 times trying to find a clean one but they were all equally disgusting ...
36,,"Hotel is centrally located. Subway station within 200 metres. Rooms are rather small and can be smelly because of smoking. Beds are rock-hard. The rooms are a bit outdated with an old TV in. No bathtub - only shower. The staff will try to help you in any way, but man, Chinese people simply don't speak English. So don't rely on the received information without double checking on it. Only one person from the hotel staff was able to communicate in English. The toilets are like in certain parts of southern Europe. Be careful with the amounts of used toilet paper or your toilet will malfunction. But still, be very happy about that standard. When you are out, don't expect a toilet, expect a hole and some solid isometric exercise of your thigh muscles. Like other reviews mention, our phone rang the first night, and we (or the I the man) was asked &quot;do you need girl company?&quot;. I refused and we weren't bothered again. The Harmony Hotel advertise with being one of the best 3 star hotels in China. In my opinion Harmony hotel is at best an average 3 star hotel in European standards and that's it.And Beijing. Can't describe it. You will have to experience it. It's easy to get around. We would recommend Beijing. And Harmony Hotel is an OK base to start every day from. But if you like soft beds, this is NOT your hotel to stay in.Camilla and Kim"
37,,"Just came back for a 3 day stay in the Hebei Guest House.The location is indeed very good! Tucked away in an old Hutong (old part with small meandering alleyways) and difficult to find, the surroundings are definetly charming and much more authentic than in any other 5 star chain hotel. Within walking distance you find the Forbidden City, TianAnMen Square, WangFuJin and the Houhai Bar area.The hotel has three buildings. The rooms in the two newer buildings have virtually no old charme and go for around 350 RMB and 650 RMB. In the back of the newer buildings are two lovely courtyards and several suite type of rooms are opening up to it. These rooms are significatly more expensive, the rack rate is about 1200 RMB and 2100 RMB, but I reckon there is some room for negotiations.We were a group of 5, and booked a triple and a double. When I made the reservation I was recomended to take the 650 RMB room, since it would be more spacious and sufficient and convenient for the triple. However when we were shown to our rooms, they were very small and in the triple a very uncomfortable cot had been squeezed between two single beds. After that unfortunately no space was left for 3 people to stand in the room not to mention to put the bags somewhere.About one meter in front of the windows was a several meters high concrete wall, so the rooms were very dark, disgustingly smelly and the plaster came down the walls. The room was dusty and grim, black undefinable stuff was stuck on the floor under the sink in the bathroom and the toilet was broken. When I asked to see another room they showed me some sort of suite with a bed with a golden/ light green headpiece which had a big grey stain where obviously people usually lay their head...The hotel could be very nice with it's location and old buildings, but it is not only overpriced but unfortunatley totaly neglected and has just not the right value for this kind of money. I had the impression the owner sees the opportunity to make a fast buck with all the tourists wanting to stay in an old fashioned Courtyard Hotel. The rooms urgently need to be cleaned properly, a facelift and some renovation. Broken things were just not fixed or only very provisonal and amateurish.The place does have a lot potential, a shame that it hasn't the right owner who appreciates it."
38,,"* nice large room* friendly staff* many good restaurants in the hotel* good breakfast* hotel organises tourist trips with guides in groups of max. 8 &gt; these are super, only negative thing here is that they oblige you to visit commercial things like factories or shops during the tour (they have some kind of agreement with these commerces)* you can order a cheap taxi at the hotel &gt; to the centre EUR 3* don't order the hotel's airport shuttle car service &gt; regular taxi is 75% cheaper."
39,,"This one year old hotel with a strange side street facade and entrance was an absolute pleasure to stay at! Huge over tech'd rooms with entrance baggage foyer, motor controlled curtains (and blackout), central lighting control, enormous bathroom and vanity areas complete with rain shower heads, separate bath and video screen, and a wonderfully comfortable king bed made our China travel centre a delight. Buffet Breakfasts (included in our price) with manned international food stations and well trained waiting staff started our days out right. Vasco's for dinner in casual attire and a staff excited to please you made a difference though the quality of food stands very well on its own. An early morning side trip flight to Xi'an brought out a full (free) box lunch including coffee and juices. Within half a block is an enormous open air mall that reflects this busy city. Grab this well priced gem while they are still building a clientele as the hotel appeared to be less than half full; a fact that seemed to only push the staff to greater efforts to please."
40,,"The Patio restaurant had a choice of A la carte or help yourself buffet - which was good value at around £13. Same applied to breakfast with a mixture of Western and Oriental food. The leisure facilities looked great, but the hotel also has various shops and other restaurants + bank and supermarket. A town in itself. It was not situated up town however, and took 20 mins to get to Tian Anmen and about the same to Olympic Park."
41,,"My friend recommended me this hotel, and I booked a room in which the hotel called Executive Floor. The main feature of this floor is a study; it is decorated with much age-old china and books to tell us what Chinese culture is look like; I love it. Generally speaking, the room is nice and the service is professional. The restaurant is pretty good, especially the buffet. It provided various delicious dishes and the price is affordable. What’s more, traffic is convenient. The hotel is nearby subway, and it’s easy to call taxi, and what I think the most convenient thing is the location. It is in the old residential district and there are many other restaurants and shops around it, so maybe you can find your flavor here and buy some articles for daily use, even kill time.I lived here just few days, but it is easy to be familiar with their staff. In this hotel, you will not feel like a foreigner or even a stranger, everyone here is friendly. According to my experience in Beijing, the hotel is your best choice if you stay in the Western Beijing."
42,,I had a choice of staying at swanky five star in the Financial street and more down to earth but comfortable holiday inn. I gave it a try to stay and I am happy i did it. Hotel has just completed renovation and rooms are brand new. Great friendly staffs. And just few minutes walk to Financial street. Will return again after the Olympics!!!
43,,"Hotel in good location with 10 minute walk to Olympic Park and five minute walk to subway. Out of city centre, but easy to get there by subway or taxi. Surrounded by wide new footpaths which are not too busy and provide a nice break from the chaos of the city centre.Entry is at the rare of the hotel via a small road, which is a little confusing at first.Several restaurants within easy walking distance.Breakfast was mediocre, although restaurant patio area nice.Internet fast and efficient.Room was nice and new, and a good size. Typical for HI Express.The only problem was that the air conditioning had been turned off (as of mid-October) and we found it a bit hot in our room.Service was good, but front desk was often very busy."
44,,I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only things that I did not like is if you went to breakfast around 7:30am instead of 6:30am it made it vary difficult to find a seat to eat and the food goes quick so you would have to wait till they bring out new trays of food. I also found that the hotel was pretty far from most places and I found it pretty difficult to get taxis some nights. The nearest subway station was about 25-30 minutes away.
45,,"This was a new hotel, It opened 10 days before i arrived. The room was nice, comfortable bed, nice new linens. Flat screen TV, in room safe. Incuded in the price was a breakfast to order.My only complaint was that one of the two elevators would sometimes come to an abrupt stop on the ninth floor. Not a good feeling since I was on the 18th.Also free internet."
46,,"Yes this is a chain hotel but it provides all you need for a short stay - good beds, bathrooms and breakfasts - actually the breakfasts wre excellent and the staff very attentive. The dinner buffets were superb too - and excellent value."
47,,"The staying at this wonderful Sihe Courtyard style hotel had been wonderful experience to our trip to Beijing. Only the food we had at various restaurants during the trip and meeting old friends (not seen for 15-20 years) can be compared to this. Being at the heart of Beijing downtown, it has a very unique surroundings where you can see many aspects of how average Beijing residents live on a daily basis. But once you set your foot inside the red front door, you would feel a totally different world that you are so far away from the dusty, noisy and busy Beijing streets and crowds that everyone else has to face.The rooms are very comfortable with plenty of shelf space for storing our luggage and frequent used items. Bedding and sheets are very nice and comfortable. Bathroom is of very decent size with modern fixtures that work really well.The hotel is equipped with Wi-Fi and a laptop PC in the lounge for the guest to use free of charge. I also used my own MacBook for emails and other things there, very nice. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. They will do whatever they can to help and/or accommodate the guests.Of course, Beijing has plenty of chain hotels like Hilton, Hyatt and Holiday Inns. If you are one of those only comfortable trying one bite of Beijing roast duck, then please do yourself a favor by staying at one of chain hotels. But if you are one of those want to know where is the best place for goose liver dish and have you-tiao (fried dough) for breakfast on the street, then this place is for you."
48,,"We went to Beijing when it had just snowed the night before, heavily. As soon as we walked in with our frozen hands and toes the receptionist welcomed us with a warm cup of tea. We sat their slowly de-frosting and it was then we looked around and saw just how cool Hotel G is. The interior design has really been thought out, its cool, trendy and inviting. We stupidly took a few photos posing in the various chairs.When we entered our room the first words were WOW! again the interior is amazing, but soft and welcoming in. You don't feel like you're in modern art museum, even though it looks like one.LAter on we ventured outside and saw just how cool this place really is. Every window is lit up in a different colour. (we later found out that you can change the colours by a flick of a switch in your room)All in all we had a great time, the service was helpful, quick and to the point.We even got to meet the manger who was the nicest person i met in beijing.The only down side was the 5 minute walk to the tube station in the snow."
49,,"We were really happy with the Ibis in Xian. We considered it the best value of the 2.5 weeks we spent in China, so we were hoping for the same standards at the Ibis in Beijing, but it fell short. The rooms were OK, but a bit worn for being such a new hotel. It opened last year. Worst parts were the lobby and hallyways and bar -- not clean and the bar always smoke-filled. There were q-tips and dental floss on the hallway carpets when we checked in and they were still there the next day. There is construction going on all around the hotel right now which makes coming and going difficult. Advantage is that it's around the corner from Line 10 subway stop which is convenient. Not too many good places to eat, but a few. Try the nearby Northern Village. Ask the hotel to direct you. This Ibis is convenient for coming and going to and from the airport, but that's about it. You could do much better location wise and it would be worth it to pay a little more to be in an area where there is more going on."
50,,"Excellent hotel with beautiful rooms, excellent service and helpful staff. Good value on executive floors"
51,,Nice hotel. The position was excellent and the staff was very helpful. Would stay again.
52,,"Very nice hotel, interesting way to turn on lights, great TV, Internet connections. Wonderful breakfast. Staff wonderful as well."
53,,the biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is close to the airport and it is also a disadvantage as taxi drivers surely are reluctant to take you from the airport to this hotel as it is close to the hotel so that they will not earn more
54,,"My daughter and I stayed at the HWA Hotel in Oct 08 for eight nights. We found it to be exactly how others described in on TA, which is to say it was a comfortable, clean, no-frills place to stay. Heck, for $74/night +tax, we were able to stay in a space nearly three times bigger than a typical hotel room. I normally don't look for luxury when I travel, since I'm out &amp; about most of the time, so this property really fit the bill for quality and tremendous value. I really appreciated having an in-room safe large enough to accomodate my laptop and free, wired internet access. I brought a Cat 5 cable with me, plugged the laptop in, &amp; in no time was checking email &amp; news from home. The kitchen appliances we used (full-size fridge, water boiler, microwave) worked fine. We didn't use the stove, so I can't comment on that. CNN International was the only English channel on TV, but a couple of other channels occasionally showed programming in English. My daughter used the pool once &amp; said it was OK. It cost RMB20 to use it. As others have noted, finding the place can be a challenge at first. If you're arriving by subway, go out exit A at Xidan station. At the top of the stairs, go right. You'll see pedestrian overpasses ahead on North Xidan St.. Take a right on the third side street where you'll see the telltale green awning. Our taxi driver from the airport had no idea where it was, even with the hotel's directions printed out, but he got us close. We got out &amp; simply walked around for about 5 minutes until we found it. The hotel shares a large building with the Xidan Shopping Center. If you're facing the Center from North Xidan St., the hotel entrance is around the corner to the right. I've attached some pictures of the area that may help.I would definitely stay at the HWA again. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for accomodations that offer very good quality and value in this magnificent city."
55,,"Room Amenities: The room is spacious, and so as the bathroom. The amenities in the room are nothing to criticize, nice mega Plasma TV, well-equipped executive work desk with stationery ….and more crucial is the housekeeper service, so courteous! View: as Bird Nest &amp; Water Cube are just around the corner, i.e. 5-10 mins walking distance, Beijing Contin. Beichen is the BEST choice if u wanna to explore these Olympics venues more~ nice view from my room window. Night scenic of Water Cube is so impressive!One thing needs to mention is the security system of this hotel! Each hotel guest can only access to their own floor by using the digital hotel room card when they use the lift. Location: the only drawback~ a bit far from the city centre, lets say 30 mins to downtown Wangfujing, Temple of Heaven, 20 mins to Sanlitun Street, etc~ but definitely convenient if u get on a taxi, fare is reasonable!The last thing I would like to mention here and the most remarkable thing is the best concierge services they provided in which impress me a lot. Both my friends and I are very pleased and impressed by Lolita, Anson and Adam. Three of them are very cordial, sincere, along with knowledgeable of various tourist sites and nice restaurants. Not only giving appropriate recommendation of our travel itinerary, but also patient in answering our enquiries. They are indeed very customer-oriented, more specifically, attention to details. We are very glad to meet them in Intercontinental Beichen that makes our trip more memorable. Many thanks to three of you! We’ll definitely stay here again if we visit Beijing in future!"
56,,"Room was very big and was exceptionally clean. All the amenities fit for a 5* were there. Bathroom had separate shower and toilet rooms along with a tub in the main area. A glass window separates it from the rest of the room so you can watch some TV while bathing. TV had DVD player. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the reception area was lightly scented to give a good, cozy ambiance.Subway station was a 5 minute walk away. Not much in terms of restaurants on this side of the street as mostly offices nearby. Never ventured across that big boulevard to search for more. Felt too intimated to cross so many lanes."
57,,The service was impeccable and the room was a very good value. The location was excellent because having been in Beijing several times before we had not had the opportunity to explore this particular area. We appreciated the service. I needed to reconfirm some flights and one of the front desk personnel was kind enough to perform that service.
58,,"Our tour stayed at this hotel, it was billed at 4 star, but this is not an international 4 star rating. The rooms were clean but in need of some refurbishment, especially the hall carpets were very dirty in places. Ask for a non-smoking room if this is important to you - they probably won't guarantee it though! We had rooms that had definately been smoked in and even a room that is smoke free will open onto a corridor which at times can be hazy with smoke - it seems guests go out in the corridor to smoke. Beds were comfortable but pillows hard and weighed a ton - never come across anything like it, you can get a soft pillow if you ask enough times. There was a water dispenser in the room, both hot and cold, which was very useful till on the second day when plugged into the socket (too noisy to leave on all night) it blew up and shorted out all the lights. A replacement was brought quite swiftly but it then proceeded to leak all over the floor. The air conditioning was turned off mid stay as they decided it wasn't necessary any more. Day temperatures were mid 20s and we disagreed. One member of the party managed to get a fan delivered to the room after it was found the windows had been screwed shut and could not be opened. The breakfast is quite good - nasty 'juice' but lots of bacon, eggs etc. plus local food if you like. We did not try the restaurants. The Business Centre is quite expensive for internet connection and when they decide it is time to close they just switch your connection off without warning! They were most accommodating in organising us a packed breakfast one morning when we had a 4am start - it took the chef, banqueting manager and another manager to organise it but they did a great job of a bacon sandwiches! There is a convenient supermarket across the road for soft drinks etc and the hotel's location is quite near both the famous Qianmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant in one direction and Tianmen Square in another - both about 10 minutes by taxi. Whilst English was spoken in the hotel most of the staff wore &quot;Trainee&quot; badges and they definately needed some training on customer service."
59,,Arrived about 2pm but my room and my colleagues were'nt ready for another 40mins. As it happens this was also the same for my other colleagues I talked to who stayed there the week before. The rooms were above average but the B wing of the hotel was far away from the main reception. The room was functional although a little dark for my liking. Breakfast was good with a lot of &quot;european&quot; choice. Overall above average hotel
60,,"Typing this review from my hotel room as it has free internet access!!We were upgrade to a 2 Bedroom suite so you can say that our stay was great! Our suite consisted of 2 bedrooms, a hall with a kitchen (complete with electric kettle, washing machine, microwave machine, full-size fridge and a stove top cooker)! There is a 60&quot; HDTV in each bedroom and also in the hall. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms lovely. We had our 5-night stay so we REALLY made use of most of the kitchen, right down to washing our clothes for the long stay.The hotel is right next to a hugh shopping mall - Joy City Shopping Mall. That's great as we can find good and cheap food on the 6th, 7th and 8th floor. The mall has many shops which sold many good quality products of international brands.Breakfast spread was really quite good and a great way to start our day of fun and shopping!!TIP: The mall is connected to the hotel via a security door on the ground floor. You just have to swipe your hotel room card at the security detector point (on the mall side) and the door will lead you to the hotel lift lobby."
61,,We're ready to go back! This hotel has such an amazing feel--you'd think you were somewhere very high end! It shares the grounds with the Ritz and it's in the Bank District. The room was huge-more than enough room for two people. Nice desk area; huge bathroom with a separate bathtub and shower. The tub has a tv mounted above it to watch. We found the staff to be very gracious and helpful. We're definitely staying here on our next trip to Beijing!
62,,"A mid-sized modern hotel with facade that's been themed after bamboos, Kapok is within walkable (~15 min) distance from Subway line 1 Tiananmen East station, Wangfujing station, and line 5 Dengshikou station. Situated near Donhuamen (East gate) of the Forbidden Palace and Wangfujing, it's location-wise competitive and can cost a whole lot less than the larger hotels that are even closer to Subway stations.The hotel is built and furnished with certain design elements that separate it from the run-of-the-mill chains; its interior has glass walls that give a sense of space while in corridors, there are sprinklings of mini-gardens, and the glass-walled bathrooms have rather stylish fixtures. All in all they make for an interesting experience, though not always comfortable (bathrooms could've been designed with more human ergonomics in mind). Rooms are generally clean, except for some mildew on the silicons at shower space. A Fashion room on 3rd floor facing the roads weren't so noisy. Maybe we were lucky. Maids were very friendly and accommodating. The front desk personnels have varying degree of competence, friendliness, and English capabilities.Though not exactly within &quot;easy&quot; walking distance from subway stations, you can go east through Donganmen St for less than five minutes then turn south to Wangfujing for eating and shopping. There are two McDonald's for quick breakfasts. To go to Tiananmen or the Forbidden Palace, go west then turn South to Nanchizi St, which has a few good (though humble-looking) Chinese restaurants that open early and have English menu. We wouldn't eat at the hotel restaurants. Cheap and good breakfasts are available ay nearby eateries, and for dinner, there are hordes of very good restaurants in Wangfujing. There are also a couple of convenience stores to each side of the hotel for stocking up on water and snacks (one near the Donghuamen-Nanchizi junction, and one near the Donganmen-Wangfujing junction).In conclusion, we think this hotel offers a very competitive combination of good location, clean accommodation, nearby nightlife, and attractive price. We do recommend this hotel."
63,,"We checked in at Kelly's courtyard in the afternoon of 16 Oct. The location is a bit hard to find but once we got inside the place we felt it was worth it. This 9-rooms accommodation is tastefully decorated, quiet and really cozy. They put jazzy ambient music on all day - which is lovely. For the bedrooms, they're rather small yet they're all clean and tidy, good enough for what we paid for. What best about this place is their hospitality! The staffs, especially Jane I must say, treated us like a family rather than hotel visitors. My partner fell ill when we first arrived so later that night I had to go up to Jane, asking for some medicine. What I'm impressed is that she took this matter very seriously. We discussed for long about the symptoms, and finally Jane decided to bring me to a pharmacy nearby, helping me in every possible way to get the right medicines (for the fact that I don't speak a word of mandarin, it's such a peace of mind to have some local assist like that) So thank you Jane! I can't thank you enough. Next time we visit Beijing, I'm sure we will meet again.Visa/Panida"
64,,"The room and bathroom was good but in need of some renovating. The staff spoked, for China, good English. The breakfast was ok, very busy area and hard to get a non smoking table. The location was good even tho we had a personal driver through all our stay. Close by the hotel there is a shopping mall and a couple of restaurants. Across the street you can find a subway station. Since there is a lot of business travelers the bar is a frequent meeting point which is good."
65,,"This review is based on 5 or 6 stays at this hotel.Fine, polished (literally) lobby. Check in service is slow, writing details down manually.The best aspect of this hotel is the rooms, which are very comfortable including high quality bedding, good climate control, and fine bathrooms with excellent showers, baths and soft towels.The rooms are not completely soundproofed so if you're noise sensitive, ask for a quieter room, perhaps on a higher floor. There is some street noise outside from traffic.The coffee shop buffet at breakfast is very good (except for the coffee: so-so), but I recommend going out rather than eating the dinner buffet which is mediocre.As is usual in China, the hotel only distributes poor quality state run newspapers, but you can get real news via fast free internet connection in every room.The hotel is 15 mins. walk or 5 mins. taxi ride from Sanlitun, an evening entertainment area with a series of bars featuring live bands, some from the Philippines.All in all, this is a reasonable and comfortable hotel for a short stay in Beijing, and better than some of the branded chains."
66,,My wife and I spent 4 nights at Lee Gardens and had a fantastic time. The location was fantastic being very close to the main pedestrian areas downtown and also close to the subway. Th rooms were very tidy and fully self contained. Best of all the staff were brilliant. If we were to return to Beijing we will be staying at Lee Gardens.
67,,"The hotel is located in the Chang Ping district and is close to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs and institutions such as Peking University. If you want to go to downtown Beijing, it is a 30 minute journey in a reasonably priced hotel car or a cab. The hotel has excellent facilities including indoor tennis courts, a bowling alley, well equipped recreation centre/ gymnasium, pool and a very good massage / spa. The restaurants are very good with an excellent range of cuisines and the Japanese restaurant is outstanding. The rooms are spacious and clean. For what you get, this is excellent value. Highly recommended."
68,,"We stayed in this hotel last October. We had some mixed feelings about the place - some good, some bad, but none fantastic or horrible.First impressions were mixed. We were arriving late at night and once we navigated into the city and onto the street of the hotel it took us 20 minutes to actually find the place. It's not directly on the road, but off in a plaza, with no well lit signage at night and no direct driveway. Our poor taxi driver didn't know where it was either, and we just kept circling around. Finally we spotted it, and had to lug our bags over a grassy median and through a parking lot to get to the hotel.The reception staff was extremely friendly, a young woman who was very enthusiastic even at the late hour. Her english was pretty good.The hotel itself feels old and creaky, but it's not necessarily a negative thing. The main halls and lobby all seemed quite clean and well cared for. There are two elevators to access the rooms.The room itself was a one bedroom loft. A split level with living/dining/kitchen/bathroom on main floor, and bedroom/shower/bathroom on top floor. It's rare to find a one bedroom two bathroom hotel room. The shower is a wet room style - you shower over the sink and among some grimy looking pipes. The furniture seemed clean but not new, the rooms were the same. They were definitely not spotless (lots of dust and grime in the bathrooms, cracks along the walls), but they were not filthy enough to make us uncomfortable - no bugs or real causes for concern, just well worn. The bed sheets were relatively clean (I had a black smudge on my pillow case). Generally we were happy with our choice - great location, good service, rooms were okay. I could see that a place like this would be great for a family, or to have a space to hang out (the split level made it feel more like a home rather than a hotel room). We enjoyed it for what we needed it for - a bed to come home to at night, and a shower.The hotel is located on a side street (Jianhua Nan lu), just off the main strip of Jianguomenwai Ave. There is not a ton of stuff right around the hotel, but there is a 24 hour 7-11 store (great to buy water, snacks, etc), and Jianguomenwai gets you to all the attractions in a flash. If you are traveling alone you might want to taxi it to the hotel at night as the side street is not well lit.There was also a great cafe right around the corner - breakfast was included for hotel guests there every morning, which was quite tasty, a mix of continental and chinese fare. Also we'd go there late at night for some tea, to use their free wireless internet and listen to their great jazz music. The staff at this cafe were so friendly, and they made a mean cup of tea.I'd probably stay here again if I were on a budget. If I could splurge a few more dollars I'd probably stay elsewhere."
69,,EXcellent hotel with very spacious and comfortable rooms.Beds felt on the hard side but slept like a log!Lovely bathrooms and towels etc also tea and coffee facilities.Ideally located for the Birds Nest and Cube which are set in a lovely extensive park where the Chinese relax and play. Super to walk around in the evening and watch the 'locals' Fantastic breakfast.Superb pool (hats required )
70,,"compared to the other 5 star hotel, the lobby is not that impressive. otherwise, I have no other complaints"
71,,"City wall Marriott was part of a Princess cruise post package. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms quite large. The concierge service was very helpful with booking an extended stay package to the Terracotta warriors for us. They have a variety of excellent dining facilities that are very reasonable in price. The only downside is that the bathroom was about 4 out of 5 stars for cleanliness -- floor abit dirty around corners and there was some blood on outside of the bathtub. But most important they have staff that speak English, and if they don't understand the request find someone who does. Also staff will wait to make sure you have/understand your ? answered. We had a flight delay and stayed by the airport and the 2nd hotel really/really made me appreciate Marriott."
72,,"I did my homework on Tripadvisor and selected this hotel out of countless hotels in Beijing. I really hit the jackpot. The hotel is located away from the noise of Beijing streets and is a welcome place to call home after a day filled with seeing the sights. You can count on a peaceful night of rest in outstanding accommodations. The entire hotel is absolutely spotless. The gym is the envy of any gym in the USA. Great swimming pools for the kids, the most modern gym equipment and opened early in the morning until late in the evening. Also has a spa with very good rates for a massage after a tour of the Great Wall of China.The staff are helpful and make you fill right at home. They go out of their way to &quot;baby you&quot; and pamper you to ensure that your stay is first class. I have been traveling for thirty years and you can pay so much more for a hotel of this quality and still not receive the level of service. The manager, Ms. Mary Goh, is sincerely interested in the comfort of the guests so do not be surprised if you are approached by a friendly lady asking you what can be done to make your stay more enjoyable. My response was &quot;Everything is just perfect!&quot;The hotel is located about a five minute walk from the Line One on the subway. During rush hour you will get a train every ten seconds once one train leaves. During regular times every minute. You are exactly thirty minutes from The Forbidden City. The price of the subway fare is under 30 cents. More convenient than a taxi ride. The subway and trains are very clean. In fact, you will be hard pressed to even find a piece of trash on the streets in Beijing. This is the safest city I have ever been to in my life. So if you are a female traveler, you do not need to have any worries about being out late at night in the city. If you wish to take a cab remember that taxis are very inexpensive so you also have this option. I stayed at this hotel a total of eight nights. Believe me, there are so many wonderful sights and places to explore in Beijing. You really need a place to rest up after the long flight from Dallas and after each day in Beijing. The beds were comfortable with plush sheets. The rooms are large and the showers are fantastic. The value for the price is simply outstanding."
73,,"The most comfortable bed I have slept in for quite some time. Nice breakfast and cozy courtyard. 4 of us also booked a private tour to the Mutinyou section of the great wall and car, guide and experience were all very positive.Only suggestion is that they should add a light in the closet so you can see in your suitcase."
74,,"This Hotel is very well located. It is not a four star hotel by any means, but the rooms are an excellent value given the location. We were traveling around China and looking for budget places to stay and this fitted well. There are shopping malls right across the street. If you like to walk you can walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen in about 15 minutes. The Dong Hua Men specialty night food market is lest that 5 minutes down the road.There is also the Dengshikou subway station which is a five minute walk away. There is also free internet in the room, and every time we went to the front desk for help there was always some there who spoke English, a big plus."
75,,"The hotel is a little out of the way in the Chaoyang District, near the Chaoyang theater (right across the street). Easy access to the subway and 10 minute ride subway to Silk Market, maybe 15 minute to Tiananmen Square. The hotel is very nice, modern rooms with LCD TV's. The breakfast buffet was excellent as well, especially suited for foreigners. I personally like the street food outside for 2 Yuan, it's the real taste of Beijing. There is a small grocery market near by if you need any snacks. One special note about the hotel is that there is a convenience store on the 7th floor (one with the pool) and the price is not that far from the local market, Tsing Tao Beer for $4 yuan per bottle..."
76,,"Stayed at the New Century with my wife who was on business. When the job ended, we stayed in Beijing for an extra week but moved to a much cheaper, three-star hotel (Beijing Shatan) that we liked better (particularly its location). Our New Century room was spacious by Beijing standards, though a bit shabby in spots (smudges on the wall, frayed spots on the carpet, etc.). Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The staff was friendly and helpful, and many spoke fairly good English. The breakfast buffet was quite amazingly comprehensive (Western, Japanese and Chinese choices). I used the gym a couple of times -- it was well equipped and almost completely empty.Don't even touch the New Century's outrageously overpriced minibar goods, which are expensive even by Western standards (including $7 Tibetan bottled water). Make a trip across the expressway (using the pedestrian walkway) and visit the Carrefour -- a French-owned department/grocery store for snacks and supplies. It's one of the most useful shopping spots in Beijing. A double-sized bottle of beer at the Carrefour will set you back less than 50 cents.If you're travelling on a five-star budget, you might check out other alternatives. If you're at all careful of your money, you can do better. But there's no particular reason to avoid the New Century."
77,,"A mistake occurred with our booking, but it was no problem, we were up-graded and we had 3 great rooms, 2 of them, suites! It was the only place we truly enjoyed in Beijing, breakfast was great, if you are a foreigner in CHINA, you need to get a good breakfast because you dont know where you might find appropriate food again! Beijing was cold but when we walked into the hotel, it felt like heaven, great service!"
78,,"I've stayed in a few 4-star hotels in Beijing and have found Novotel Xinqiao to be among the best. However, THIS STATEMENT ONLY APPLIES TO ROOMS IN THE NEW WING (if I remember correctly, the new wing is known as the A wing, while the old wing is the B wing). The rooms in the new wing are slightly larger, have more modern fixtures, are cleaner, and have more natural light. If rooms in the new wing are not available, go elsewhere because the old wing rooms are lousy. I think the differences in the rooms of each wing account for the sometimes contradictory reviews found on this thread.If your hotel rate doesn't include breakfast, a great alternative is the hotel's little coffee shop by the main entrance. The coffee there is magnificent and they sell pastries as well.Parking is RMB10 per hour or RMB50 per day. This applies whether you're parked in their underground garage or on the street in front. A great way to travel around this area is by rickshaw. On a previous visit I rode from Qianmen back to the hotel on a rickshaw for RMB10 and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I had during that trip.One negative about this hotel is that they don't always keep their word when it comes to meeting guests' requests for non-smoking rooms. I've stayed here three times, and twice they gave me smoking rooms even though I had explicitly requested non-smoking ones. They eventually switched me to non-smoking rooms but that was only after the first night."
79,,"I booked Oakwood through Expedia due to the description, and thought it was going to be not much different from other hotels. Well, the rooms are large but the front desk service is poor. It took me more than an hour just to check in. If you are a foreigner, they register your passport with the local police, and the process takes 4 hours. It was a unpleasant surprise."
80,,"Traveled to Beijing in Oct 2009. Stayed in Orange hotels for 3 nights. the room is clean but relatively small. But it is not an issue. 1st night i felt that the pillow has some smell, have requested to change it. after that is fine.5 mins walking distance to MRT station. There is one Nine head eagle (???) restaurants beside this hotel, it served delicious food. with hotel card can get 10% discount. I recommend it to those who stay at orange to try it."
81,,"We travelled with one other couple from Shanghai to Beijing on July 25th and stayed at the Oriental Bay International Hotel for five days. We were impressed with our rooms and the magnificent lobby. Staff were courteous and polite. There is a canal in front of the hotel and the metro or subway is a short walk along the canal under a busy intersection and back up onto the main street. The rear of the hotel leads out into a street with small stores where you can purchase basic packaged food staples. A few small restaurants are also on this street. There is a local Internet Cafe close to the hotel and can be located by walking to the street at the rear of the hotel, turn left until the end of the street and then turn left again, the internet cafe is the last building on this street. We enjoyed the Western buffet breakfast at the hotel in the morning complete with egg omelette, pancakes, bacon, toast and an assortment of Chinese food."
82,,All was what I would have expected given the low price except the TV reception was vey poor but most importantly there was no a/c. Having asked the staff numerous times I was told every time they would have someone check the a/c. Being my inquisitive self I discovered the had it entirely turned off to save money. I woke wih little sleep this morning to a sweaty hot and 31 degree room and right now (9pm) its 26. Staff have advised to &quot;open a window&quot;...in noisy polluted Beijing right! Besides..its made no difference. We are moving out tomorrow.
83,,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of China and found it to be quite comfortable with pleasant staff and good surroundings.The hotel boasts a garden complex next door (hence its name) which is free to hotel guests on presentation of your room key. The locals have to pay to get in which many do as it appears to be a central point for early morning exercises such as Tai Chi, Badminton and a variety of other games enjoyed by the Chinese.The rooms have either twin double beds or one king size bed, television, airconditioning, safe, tea and coffee facilities, lounge and combined bath shower. For those that can afford it they even have suites available which are quite large.Breakfast is a combination of western and local foods, plenty of it and it is quite sufficient for most people. The hotel has a small but comprehensive shopping arcade that has for sale a myriad of local items at relatively cheap prices as well as a tailor that promises to make a suit within 24 hours at a moderate price.It has a unique &quot;Old World&quot; ambience about it with everything in dark wood that is characteristic of the Chinese. The staff were friendly enough and could speak fairly good English which made for easy conversation when checking in and out.All in all not a bad hotel."
84,,"This place is really targeted for long term stay (e.g. over 2 weeks). The rooms are huge and well decorated. Everything you could possibly need is provided.The hotel, it's a serviced apartment really, is located inside one of the most upscale apartment compound in Beijing. The club house has a good size gym that's not crowded and a huge spring water pool, excellent for families. The garden inside the compound is enormous and fantastic to walk around.Yes, the location may not be convenient on face value, but if you ask the front desk to write down the compound name in Chinese, almost all taxi drivers know how to get there. The location is actually very good because it has easy access, without getting stuck in traffic, to Sanlitun, CBD and the 4th ring road, for quick access to the airport and Lido area.As it is a serviced apartment, don't expect the same type of service that you would get from a 4 or 5 star hotel concierge, however the front desk will try very hard to help you.The fact that many of the guests in this hotel/serviced apartment are long residents is evidence of the good service, location and room quality.If you want a 5 star breakfast, this is probably not for you. The selection is limited, and there is no 24 hour room service. The restaurants in the club house do room service for lunch and dinner.For full disclosure, we are long term residents at the Marriott."
85,,"I stay there from September 30 to October 4, 2009 for 60th Anniversary of PRC.We purchased our hotel nights via Park Hyatt Official website. Their website was advertising &quot;City Gateway&quot; which included a bottle of red wine, mooncake and CNY500 Spa coupon. However, after few days of staying when we asked about this offer, Park Hyatt staffs were saying that they never had such a promotion.Later, they came back saying it was their aggressive promotion from their marketing team and their internet system has some problem.Due to this confusion on their end, our feeling for staying their place was completely ruined.If you want peace of mind, it is not worth to deal with their inexperienced hotel staffs.Horrible experience...PARK HYATT should know how terribly this place is running..."
86,,"I am writing this review at the Peixin - the computer in the room is an excellent bonus! I have just read the previous reviews and would like to comment that this is my 7th hotel in China and the beds are the same firm matress everywhere, so that is a non-issue. There only IS one English language TV channel - CCTV channel 9 - in China, so you can't blame the hotel for that! Yes, the hotel is a taxi ride from Tian'amin Square but the ride is 12 Yuan - les than $2 - and takes 10 minutes, which makes this hotel great value. The rooms are clean, my single has a king bed, and the room is quite spacious. The breakfast buffet is very good and great value for 20 yuan - served from 6:30 to 9:00. I had a problem with this computer and housekeeping was at my door within 5 minutes to solve the problem. The hotel is non-smoking which is a pleasant change from most hotels in China, and is listed as a &quot;Green Hotel&quot;. I booked on-line and the price was a lot cheaper than the posted rack-rate at the hotel. I would definitely recommend the Peixin - great value for the money."
87,,"Stayed for three nights as part of a tour. Had two room keys so it was handy if two of you needed to come back at different times or to leave one in the room so that the air con stayed on. Rooms were very warm even with air con (think some one moved rooms because of this). A thick duvet on the bed, as with most of the Chinese hotels we stayed at. Room not particularly big but clean. Kettle and tea/coffee sachets provided. Lighting quite dark, various spotlights, no main ceiling light. Slippers even replaced. Fun to watch the ten lanes of traffic or so if you’re on that side. Had a massage card put under the door!Didn’t see many shops of interest, but there was a handy petrol station - turn right up the same side of the road - selling a few basics. The off-licence the other way seemed to want to rip tourists off - told us bottled water was about 4 times the usual going rate. Go to the petrol station instead, fixed prices and they sell beer! KFC right outside the hotel.Breakfast room was very busy, food was nice - excellent banana bread/cake.Can send postcards via the concierge by the front desk, although always dubious when you hand over the money and they say they’ll put the stamps on, most arrived but one didn’t.Had a few goes at trying to change travellers’ cheques at reception as the person who dealt with the exchange was away from the desk on other business, but managed to do so in the end - but thought a £2 sterling charge on a £50 cheque a bit steep."
88,,"Big entrance, but rooms a bit out of date. Needs some renovation, I would say it is a better 4 star hotel."
89,,"it is a nice hotel, all the equipments are brand newalthough far away from hotel, walking distance to metro station, can go everywhere easily by subway.staff is very friendly, but seem lack of experience, sometimes even how to do with certain proceduresshortage...hotel is in cemetery area....a little bit weired, but it's ok la.."
90,,"Qianyuan was a very nice hotel based on Chinese standards. The room decor was very pleasant, but the walls are very thin. You can hear everything in the hall and adjacent rooms, so bring earplugs. The beds are very hard, harder than the other hotels I stayed. The shower door leaked and flooded the bathroom floor but I remedied this by pointing shower head at the wall.. This hotel provides room safes unlike the other hotels I stayed. The rooms were clean, staff was helpful, and location was perfect. It was just a 5-10 minute walk from Beixingqao and Dongzhimen subway stations. You can catch the 916 bus at Dongzhimen bus stop to Mutianyu Great Wall. The hotel is located on a very busy street that has tons of restaurants. I recommend the Yunan noodle shop across the street, order the fried noodles for 10 RMB. There is also an excellent massage place across the street that cost 99 RMB for 1.5 hr foot and shoulder massage. It is also located just 10 min walking distance from the llama temple, Confucian temple and Imperial Academy."
91,,"I have stayed in several hotels in Beijing over the last five years, including both Ritz Carltons, the Grand Hyatt, Intercontinental, Regents, China World, and more.The Raffles is my new home during stays in Beijing. From the moment you enter, John Spooner greets you with warm tea and literally acts as your personal butler during the duration of your stay. The check in process is smooth and flawless.The rooms are nicely appointed, having stayed in a junior suite. The beds are a little hard, but having travelled thru Asia, I have become accustomed to this reality. The internet worked perfectly (complementary wireless) and I run high bandwidth applications.Breakfast was delish! A great spread and no complaints. I did not eat additional meals at the hotel.All things considered, the Raffles is in a great location. Close to the shopping malls, the Forbidden City and Tianmen Square. I strongly recommend this hotel to all - absolutely no complaints."
92,,"The hotel is almost brand new, when I stayed over there. Just a year old. Build and opened in 2008 before the Olympic Games. So the hotel is not very well-known to taxi driver, but the area.The service in the hotel is brilliant. I was treated very nice. I booked a room in executive floor and the staff in the executive lounge was very nice and care for the guests very much. At least for me. One day my air condition didn't work and they repaired it immediately and offered me a new room in case they cannot repair it. That's nice. They gave me always the same room, which I prefered. That's what you can call service. The Hotel Manager excused for the internet problems I had and I got a voucher. The staff really cares for the problems of the guests and they are very polite and friendly.The rooms are quite nice. Clean, always taken care of, quite big, with a desk inside and a big restroom with shower bath and so on. The rooms are new, as the whole hotel. Very good.The hotel itself is located directly at the third ring road. Actually I thought you might hear anything, but no sound. Absolutely silent. You can watch third ring road, if you have a room to the front. The area is well known to taxi driver, just the hotel not. You will find easily a taxi to go everywhere. One big advantage is the subway station 2 minutes walkway from the hotel. There is also a big shopping mall beside the hotel. Very convenient. A lot of shops around the hotel, which makes life easy and your stay comfortable. The hotel also got some restaurants, which I must honestly say, never visit. I always was out. You can find some good restaurants close to the hotel as well. The hotel got also a bar in the 4th floor. And that is the only disadvantage of the hotel.The bar in the 4th floor close very early and the staff over there is not very familiar with english language. That's the only thing from my point of view, the hotel has to improve. In regards to the Swimming Pool and the Spa area, I cannot make any comments, because this area was under reconstruction, when I stayed over there. So I couldn't use it. But it looks quite interesting.Result: I feel very comfortable and very welcome in this hotel. The location is very good and the staff very nice. It is a good recommendation to explore Beijing. It is also very good for your business activities, because they offer all you need for that."
93,,"We stayed here en route to and from Mongolia. We had no time to visit Beijing itself, but wanted somewhere within 30 mins of the aiport.I booked a club room in order to get the inclusive airport transfer, which worked out cheaper than paying seperately for both. The airport pick-up was seamless, the hotel staff helpful and courteous, the room comfortable, and the bathroom spotless. On the way home we were upgraded to a suite, which was a nice surprise, and had time to enjoy the excellent buffet breakfast.I'd definitely recommend this hotel."
94,,"We had high expectations - this was the last stop on a trip to China and we had stayed in some fabulous hotels during our 17 day visit. I should have looked into the location more - we were only there for two nights and we had visited Beijing before but some time ago. The hotel is not convenient for anything. It is the other side of town to the airport and given the traffic issues, 30 minutes or more from most places you would want to visit as a tourist.Whilst the staff spoke English, it was not to the standard expected from a 5* eastablishment. There were some bizarre recommendations - we were staying in the most expensive wing of the hotel and the recommendations included a dreadful fake market as a top sight. It took over half an hour to get to and was hard to get back from - and completely rubbish selling nothing you would want. After Shanghai the shopping here was awful.On arrival at the hotel the concierge questioned us - doubting we were staying in the Valley Wing - not a good start. The Valley wing lounge has a view which is like a cross between the A4 or Hammersmith Flyover and Spagetti junction. This was the same view as from our room.The restaurant service was poor - we were made to feel less than welcome when we truned up at 9.30 and last orders were 10pm. The staff were much more interested in going home that serving us.The rooms were comfortable and the lounge offered a free flow of Champagne all day and canapes early evening. The canapes were not as good as at some other hotels we have stayed in, including on this trip. The pool was not particularly inviting, especially given the plastic lane dividers that made it look like a public baths, rather than a plush, comfortable 5*retreat."
95,,Room are spacious &amp; clean. The Staff are really helpful &amp; most of them can speak english. To get to the subway took around 7-8 mins. Most of my time where out sightseeing &amp; shopping so I didn't get a chance to use their facilities.
96,,Stayed in Shatan Hotel during a 4 month backpacking holiday and felt very spoilt. The hotel is lovely with 24hr concierge and in a great secluded location behind the forbidden city. The street that the hotel is on seems very rustic but the hotel itself is very nice. The enterance to the beautiful jinshang park is only meters away and here you can get incredible photos of the whole of the forbidden city. Would definately recommend this hotel.
97,,"I like this hotel very much, given it's location and the comfort level of the room. However, the service of their front counter staff (Cashier section or Check in section) leaves a lot to be desired. Check in on 19 Oct, check out 25 Oct.During check-in, I waited 10 mins before I had to bring myself to the cashier staff to be served. The staff were just walking to and fro and I was like an Invisible person standing there waiting. I did not get the non-smoking room which I requested in my booking, in addition, if I wanted to get a room change, I can only wait until after 10pm. Where's the logic? Check out is from 3pm, right? I checked in at 4-5plus in the evening.When I went for my breakfast, there was a foreign Caucasian couple behind me, they got asked first on whether they needed a table for two? Again, I am Invisible!On the third night, the aircon broke down, when I called to ask, the staff said it's a national issue (the whole city shuts down airconditioning during winter). But on the 5th night, I was informed that it was working again due to a faulty maintenance a few days ago. My conclusion is because I am Asian looking (like their fellowmen), they will prefer to serve a foreigner first instead. Low class service in a High class hotel.BUT this place serves great breakfast and have very comfortable rooms. Only complaint on the room is the pillows are too soft, orthopedic pillow too hard. Try providing the pillows that Sheraton Hotels provide and it is fantastic!"
98,,"This is the hotel that I most liked in my whole trip in China. The building is pretty and has the charm of old chinese houses, though it's a very recently built hotel. My room was very clean and the service was excellent. They helped me find a doctor who can speak English when I was sick. They helped me buy a SIM card for my mobile (they literally went out with me to the shop and dealt with the clerk). You wouldn't expect that from a hotel that charges under $30 a night.I found the location very good. It's right next to a metro station and the surrounding area is quiet and very pleasant to walk in if you like to explore narrow streets and old neighborhoods. It's not very far from Tian'anmen and the forbidden city, though you'll need to take the metro or a taxi unless you wanna take a pretty long walk.The room was a little bit small, but the bed was big and comfortable. The main drawback is that you can hear the noise from the hallway, so expect to hear noise in the morning around 8 as people get up."
99,,"Service was pretty good. The room itself wasn't very clean or maintained (1 bedroom executive). There's a glass divider between the bathroom and main bedroom for this size room, so it's horrible when you have visitors that need to use the restroom. There was mold growing all over the wood that's part of the glass dividing wall, because the caulking to the tub leaked. They fixed the caulking but the mold was still there. The covers won't stay on the cushions correctly, they slide around. They claim 75 square meters for this size room, I don't see it, it's closer to 60 from my measurement. Their 60 is more like 45 from the one I saw (but didn't measure). When asked they claim they're advertising the room sizes according to the engineering diagrams of the building and not true floor space. I still don't see 15 square meters being eaten up by exterior walls. They also keep the swimming pool freezing cold (which is odd becuase chinese seem to have an aversion to cold).Overall, not the 4 stars they claim to be, and i think there's false advertising for their room sizes. It's maybe 2.5 or 3. stars. Complaining after you sign the contract meets blank faces, once you sign you aren't going to get a room change. The location is pretty good though, close to subway line 10 (which is 2rmb to any station in the city). Really, Chaoyang is where all the major malls and entertainment is and that's on the other side of Beijing, so you'll spend a lot of time on the subway or spend a lot on cab fair to get there if you stay here (around 40RMB each way between Haidian and Chaoyang from my experience). The Olympic park is just off of subway line 10, so I'm sure this was convienient during the Olympics. Basically, i think for the price there are better options both in quality and location."
100,,"We had a wonderful time staying in this very charming hotel with traditional Chinese style decoration. The room is clean and comfortable, the staff is friendly and location is close to local attractions. Very unique experience compare to living in a regular 4 star hotel. We love it. If you like to experience the traditional Chinese culture and Beijing &quot;Hu Tong&quot; , it is the place to be."
101,,"I stayed here with my girlfriend in September 2009. Location was great, near the metro and close to many restaurants. Room was clean and comfortable. I was also able to buy a train ticket to Xi'an here which was great because I initially thought I would have to go to the train station itself to buy the ticket. I recommend this hotel."
102,,"This is my second visit to Beijing and I stayed here with my colleague for a duration of a month. First impression i had from front office was they still recognize me when after 6 months later i'm back to Beijing!! Everything was outstanding, from the staff, to the service and they do provided what i want same as last stayed and they gave me the same room as last visit on January which i'm very suprise and happy as I only told them once before i leave on 14 Feb 2009. Internet is very important for all business people, both me and my colleague was very grateful that during our stay there was no intermittent on our internet connection and that had made our business process very successful. Only thing was this second visit, there is quite a few websites which i can't get in which I'm believe it's block.I would like to recognize your Front Office colleague who had assist me witt everythings.I would like to thank Mr. Liu. the Manager &amp; Concierge Team who always give me best travel advise and the outstanding service that they had given. On the other hand, the choices of food on the room service menu needs to be more variety and presentation must be consistent as I'm order one same thing but everytime delivered to my room was given different item. Level of service from the server needs to be more attentive in terms of anticipating the guest need. Nevertheless, overall, i had an outstanding stay at your hotel.Thank you all of your which giving me a OUTSTANDING stay at Swissotel Beijing!!"
103,,"You can go to Beijing, stay in a western style hotel, and say you have been to Beijing. Or you can stay at a hotel such as the Templeside Deluxe Hutong House and say you have experienced Beijing.This is because as the name suggests the hotel is in a hutong and from the moment you step out the door you are in an authentic, everyday Beijing setting with local people going about their normal day to day life.The hotel itself is an old family home which has seven guest rooms set around a central courtyard. The rooms are a good size and have everything you need to have a comfortable stay while the courtyard doubles as the eating area and a place to meet fellow travellers. We found everything about the hotel to be clean and well presented.Bobby the owner speaks excellent English and one of his younger staff members who is always there when he is not also speaks good English. The rest of the staff have minimal English but they know their job well enough to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The food, whether it is the breakfast prepared at the hotel or other meals ordered from a nearby restaurant, is very good and very cheap.The day we left we caught the night train to Xian but even though we had checked out of our room in the morning the hotel minded our luggage for the day and allowed us to have a shower before we left to catch the train.The nearest subway station is an easy 10-15 minute walk and taxis are easy to get by walking 2 minutes to the nearest main road. Each morning we walked to the subway by heading west through the hutong knowing that we would eventually come to the main road where the station is. We were always the only non-Chinese around. At night though we would use the main roads to ensure we found the right alley way to get to the hotel and not get lost.A tip that may be handy. We found getting taxis to the hotel difficult even though we had the name and address written in Chinese. Drivers either don't know where it is or are reluctant to drive into a hutong as it can take them so long to get back out. It is best to get hotel staff to write the nearest main intersection to give to the taxi driver and walk the two or three minutes to the hotel from there.The sights of Beijing are spread all over the city so no one hotel is going to be central to them all. With this in mind do yourself a favour and pick a hotel with a difference and actually experience the life of the city. You probably won't be here again so make the most of your stay and take home some true memories."
104,,"We spent one night in a deluxe suite (we were upgraded on arrival by Mark, the hotel manager) in early November. The entire experience was fabulous! Our suite was glorious, with an ante-room connecting it to the suite in which our friends were staying, a very large living room, a beautiful master bedroom and a nicely appointed en-suite bathroom (with the best bathrobes I have ever encountered anywhere). The property is laid out in a series of attractive, serene, interconnecting courtyards, and incorporates a number of buildings that were guest houses for visitors to the Summer Palace in Qing dynasty times. The hotel has a private entrance into the grounds of the Summer Palace, our visit to which was the highlight of our stay. Hendry at the front desk was very helpful in organising an itinerary, driver and guide for our foray into town to see Tienanmen Square, the Forbidden City and a hutong. We only ate one meal at the hotel. The four of us ordered a room service lunch from the Chinese menu on the day we checked out, which was served to us in the ante-room between the two suites; it arrived in 25 minutes and was absolutely superb. Good wine list, too.Very minor quibbles: it would be good to have a library of DVDs for guests (there were only 2 when we were there, one of them fortunately being The Last Emperor); and the mattresses are on the firm side, so it might be good to have a pillow-top option for guests who prefer a softer mattress."
105,,"The Emperor was a fun, modern hotel with an amazing location - during a four day stay I could walk to most of the places I wanted to visit and was a short trip to the subway for anything else. The hotel is metres from the wall of the Forbidden City along a small, quiet road.The room was clean and large and full of nice touches - rainforest shower, free minibar, free wireless and a free chinese stamp. Breakfast had a good selection of western and Chinese food.The roof bar is fantastic with great views over Beijing - only problem was that it was very quiet whilst I was visiting (although October is maybe not ideal roof bar weather).Service was good - and best of all they let me check into my room when I arrived at six in the morning. They even offered me an extra breakfast for that morning.Only downside was that taxi drivers didn't know where the hotel was even with a card in chinese with a map on it. I had a few taxi drivers refuse to take me, but it never took long to find one that would."
106,,This room was amazing. After a long day seeing the sites in Beijing it was a pleasure to come back here.
107,,"Stayed here for 3 nights - What you would expect from a 5* hotel, but nothing special.Location is as good as anywhere in Beijing. The City is enormous so not matter where you stay some attractions are going to be far away. This close to Forbidden City though, and some good shopping nearby.Hotel itself is nice. Lobby bar a little disappointing, seems like something of an afterthought. Prices are steep for Beijing, though service is on the whole very good. The breakfast buffet downstairs in their restaurant was good; didn't eat there for any other meals so can't speak for the other 2 Chinese places.Rooms were very nice. Big flatscreen, dvd player. Lots of plugs, including a UK 3 pin plus which was a nice touch. Bed very comfy, though pillows a little soft for me. Great bathroom with plenty of room, decent shower. TV a nice touch but fairly pointless.Overall a very fine hotel and we got a great deal which made it even better. Service is up there with the best. So you get exactly what you pay for."
108,,"Prior to booking this hotel, I was scheduled to stay at the Westin Chaoyang. This would have been a free stay as I have a ton of Starwood points. However, the reviews were mixed and the more I thought about it the location seemed really inconvenient. Also though of staying at the Hotel Kapok, as it had a great location, great price and modern design which I like. However, I am a serious swimmer and wanted a pool, so ended up staying at the Regent Beijing, largely based on the good reviews on these boards.It turned out to be a good choice. The location was top notch. About a 6 minute walk to Wangfuging shopping, and about a 20 minute walk to the Forbidden City. Despite what others have said on these boards, I believe that location is really key in picking a hotel in Beijing. While the subway is efficient and cheap, they are extremely crowded and can be unpleasant to ride. Taxis are cheap, but Beijing traffic can be awful. So, it is a real bonus to be able to walk to many attractions. Plus if you do have to take the subway or subway, your will tend to have a shorter ride (with the exception of the Summer Palace) if you stay at the Regent. Note that there is a subway (Line 5) adjacent to the hotel. It doesn’t get more convenient than that!The design of the hotel if modern as opposed to traditional, and rooms are very cheerful. One wall of the bathroom is glass, but when you put the automatic blinds down you will have full privacy.The 26 meter pool was real bonus – nice temperature and hardly used at all. It was great to go swimming after a chaotic day of sightseeing, followed by the Jacuzzi and sauna. The Jacuzzi was a godsend after climbing the Great Wall!Service was generally good. The staff’s English was not perfect but they could speak it well enough to understand me and be helpful.I did have some minor problems with the room, but they were just minor.Free Intnet (via cable) in the room made my trip so much easier. There supposedly free Wi-Fi in the lobby, which I tried to use with my iPhone but never had any luck.So, in summary, an enjoyable stay. I would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again if I were ever to return to Beijing."
109,,"We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. The room and service were superb. The staff at the concierge and bell desk were particularly friendly and helpful. Loved the food at Qi (the Chinese restaurant). Although it is located in the business district, getting to the usual tourist sites (within the city) was easier than we expected. We initially planned to use the subway but as the traffic wasn't too congested, we took taxis everywhere instead. The most expensive fare was only RMB25 and that was from the southern side of the Temple of Heaven (20-25mins). It is very true that most taxi drivers don't know the hotel (9 out of 10, literally)...so make sure you carry the hotel's address card/map with you. Also, tell them it's next to Datong Bldg...and they'll be able to find it. The plus side of the quieter location is that we were able to really relax after a long day or sightseeing."
110,,"Don't get me wrong, the Ritz Carlton is excellent by all means. Just that I had the privilege to stay at its sister hotel JW Marriott which is connected by an underground walkway, on a separate occassion, and felt the rooms looked more spacious than the Ritz Carlton (though according to the website, the Ritz rooms measure slightly bigger). It could be due to the JW Marriott using see-through glass panels for its bathroom wall which separated the bathroom from the bedroom, giving the illusion of a bigger room. Decor-wise, Ritz goes for a elegant Victorian feel while the Marriott is more of a modern dark chic theme."
111,,"Nice, quiet location. Great restaurants. Not as opulent as other St. Regis hotels, but will stay there again."
112,,"The Hotel is a really 5 stars Hotel, great Lobby, great Rooms, clean and full of amenities.A few interesting bars and restaurants, Club Floor is spacious and confortable.The only minus is the place, not so central as for example the Grand Hyatt.Price is on the high range but in Beijing if you want quality you must be ready to pay for it.Recommended for Business meetings."
113,,"Having stayed in over 20 hotels for more than 500 nights over the past 2 years on the road, Beijing Westin Financial St remains my first choice in Beijing.I am quite numb to hotels and so long as the rooms are clean, internet is fast, there are not much to complain, afterall, i just need a roof for the night and a internet cable to do my work at night.However, this hotel stands out over the rest simply for one reason: genuine care and concern for guests. There was once i am down with flu and the nice ladies from Club lounge happened to know about it. I was pleasantly surprised when they bought fresh juice and porridge to my room and told housekeeping to send more bottles of water.This is only one of the more memorable incidents and not to mention the special effort to remember my last name, drinks preferences or even how i like my eggs done, details like this that could be taken for granted but seldom encountered elsewhere.Looking forward to meeting the nice folks there on my next trip!"
114,,"10 years ago I stayed in this hotel for my first business trip to Beijing. It still has this impressive central hall. Apart from that, since then there has been no renovation and the management quality has detriorated. The breakfast budget still has some nice spots but also quite some room for improvement (running out of some items very early, dangerous looking sushi). Room service, even on the weekends, comes only around 3pm. Bathrooms seem to be partially redone. But still have floor standing toilets, not wall hung toilets like modern hotels have, therefore still unclean and dirty looking. Overall hotel is ok but could do better."
115,,"I stayed at this hotel at the end of an organized tour. We were booked for two nights with the tour and then I stayed an extra five days before switching to another hotel for a 3 week stay. I really appreciated this hotel a lot more after switching to my other hotel. This hotel is conveniently located right off Wangfujing Street and the night market. One of the biggest English bookstores in on Wangfujing street. There is a subway stop (Denhshikou Station) right down the road which is on line 5. The area is pretty safe, there are little shops all the way down the street where you can buy water, soda, food, etc. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. It's not a Super8 anymore and all those signs were taken down. There is hotel restaurant that serves a breakfast buffet which is decent for China standards. They have Internet access for 5yuan for a 1/2 hour or 10 yuan for an hour. It's a lot easier to use their Internet then trying to find an Internet cafe. There are plenty of restaurants around. The rooms are spacious, they had 3 English speaking stations on the TV including HBO which can be nice after a long day of touristy stuff. The bathroom is very nice. The shower is roomy. Everything in the room was very clean and the housekeeping staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
116,,"My family and I stayed at the Tiantan Hotel for 4 nights near the end of June as a part of a 10-day package tour of China. The hotel was part of the tour package for our stay in Beijing and we booked out three rooms. Overall, we liked the hotel, but we do have some nits to pick.The main &quot;nits&quot; that we had:1.) As a family, we wanted 3 rooms that would be near to each other. We were told that they could accomodate this request and we were given 3 rooms that appeared to be next to each other (i.e., sequential room numbers). When we got to our rooms, we realized that despite the sequential room numbers, one room was in actuality down the hall and around the corner (due to a quirk on how the rooms are layed out) and not really near the other two. When we called back downstairs to ask if we can have a closer room than that, we were then told that it was the only room available to us. Not the world's biggest deal, but somewhat annoying when the staff had earlier assured us that all 3 rooms would be next to each other. [Note: The staff's English is only so-so, but my family and I can speak Mandarin, so this was not an issue of being &quot;lost in translation.&quot;]2.) Complete and total lack of variety in their lobby background music. Strange nit you say? For 2 days straight, the lobby background music was the same instrumental version of &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot; on INFINITE LOOP. No other song was played (not even another song from Evita). It's amazing how quickly a song can drill into your head when it's the ONLY SONG playing over and over and over... Part way through breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, I wanted to grab some bread to stuff into my ears just to block out the sound and keep my sanity.Beyond these nits, this is a perfectly nice hotel to stay at. The rooms are very clean and nice (though the beds are like most Chinese hotel beds... VERY firm). It was easy to set a wake-up call and our wake-up calls were always on time. As also stated by the previous reviewers, this hotel is near the Temple of Heaven (for which the hotel is named for) and the Pearl Market (great shopping if you love to haggle). It is also right across the street from the Red Theater (the home of the &quot;Beijing Kung Fu Show,&quot; a popular stop for Western tour companies). I can't speak to the nearness of other tourist attractions as our tour bus would pick us up and drive us to the various places and I did not really pay attention to time or distance.The breakfast buffet is not too bad. It has good variety and has probably a 60/40 mix of Western/Chinese food items. In my opinion, the Chinese food items are definitely better than the Western ones. There is also an omelet bar where the chef will either fry eggs or omelets for you.We also had a late dinner in the Rainbow Restaurant one night. We kept the meal simple to noodles, fried rice, and dumplings and the food was very good... especially the dumplings."
117,,I went with my family to Beijing last month. Incidently I booked Traders since it is very close to the shopping areas. But the rooms of this hotel are not good at all.
118,,"Needing a place to overnight between my work in Zhangzhou and my flight out of Beijing home, I started (as I always do when traveling in Asia) with my membership at the Shangri-La chain. For those unfamiliar with this chain, it's a great, four star hotel that caters to business travelers from all countries.The Traders is situated about halfway between the Beijing airport and the center of the city so it's perfect as a jumping off point in either direction. For a fee, they arranged for me to be picked up at the airport and then taken back in time to make my flight the following afternoon. Even before checking in, the staff was seeing to all my needs. I had emailed the Guest Relations Officer asking about going to Mass Sunday morning. She responded with all the information I needed on the closest Catholic church. The driver was waiting for me after I collected my luggage and the car was stocked with bottled water for the short, twenty minute drive to the hotel. The Guest Relations Officer (Vivian Gong) with whom I had traded emails earlier, met me at the door, ushered me to my room and, because I'm a member, just had me sign the paperwork in my room. She asked if the church she had found would be acceptable and which Mass I would like to attend. She said that she would arrange a wake up in time for me to meet a prearranged taxi that would take me to church.The room was a good size with all the amenities (soaps, shampoo, razor, toothbrush &amp; toothpaste, comb, and fully stocked minibar complete with adult beverages, soft drinks, and snackfood. The food from room service was excellent and the staff was superior to the point of feeling very pampered.The following morning I got in and out of a day of church and shopping in Beijing without a hitch and, when the time came, Ms. Gong was there to accompany me from the front desk to the waiting car.I always expect the best from the Shangri-La chain and have never been disappointed."
119,,"Good location near the Forbidden City. We stayed in a suite on the executive floor with one bedroom, one living room and a big bath room which was very good value and also included a breakfast buffet either in the executive lounge or in the coffee shop."
120,,"Walk of 4 long blocks to subway station. Kind of inconvenient. Found out there are scheduled (every half hour) airport shuttle bus to - from Beijing National airport. Do not try to carry luggage taking subway which was told by this hotel. Email to this hotel was not answered. Room 508.Air conditioning does not work. Just blowing fan. Toilet water gets in very slowly after flash. Stain everywhere, carpet, lamp shade, Room service food is priced reasonable, OK and quick, but only a few selections. Our group stayed at 7 different rooms, all air conditioning are poor to deliver cool air.Room 709:Shower stall leaked water at every shower due to non-closure of rubber seals. Shower items, including lotion, soap, bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner not replenished each day. Room temperature remained constant despite attempts to lower degrees. Shower items were of excellent high quality, especially the hand lotion. Very nice complement of bath items offered, including sewing kit, toothbrush, paste. Shower bath gel dispenser on wall was difficult to squeeze especially for those people with smaller hands. Noise control in each room was excellent.Very nice swimming lap pool. Surprise, so quiet, no body use it.Very nice rec room down stairs too. Gym not fully equip."
121,,"I stayed in this hotel while on a school trip to China. It was much better than I expected! When our bus arrived to the hotel, the staff took all of our bags off the bus and up to the lobby and then to our room after we checked in. While waiting for check in, staff treated us to plates of fruit and pastries. Staff amazingly spoke English and understood what we needed. With a currency exchange office in the hotel, this was also a major convenience. There was also some restaurants in the hotel and shopping close by. The rooms were spacious and pretty comfortable. The only negative was the temperature was a little warm in the rooms. It was hard to cool down even when the thermostat was all the way down. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay here for being a mid class hotel."
122,,"I've really got no complaints about this hotel, but no real compliments either. The rooms were clean, but spare.The staff was nice, but not great with English.The location isn't really near anything except Beijing's pitiful zoo, but it's right across the street from that.The breakfast buffet was large, but I blame some warm milk for making me puke one day. There is one of those revolving restaurants on the top floor."
123,,I stayed there for a couple of days on my business trip. The hotel is placed near universities sites. The location of the hotel is hidden from the main street. The hotel accommodates several buildings. My room was located in a building next to the main building. In the building where I was placed the breakfast wasn't served every morning so I had to walk in cold freezing morning of December to the main building to have my breakfast.Internet was OK. Only one English TV channel.
124,,"I stayed here for three nights in September and rebooked for two nights in October before I flew home. I thought the rooms were more than adequate, cleaned daily and the staff did a super job of handling my sub standard Mandarin. This was my first trip to China and when I return I will definitely consider the Zhong An. Within a couple of blocks of the train, subway and markets, not to mention easy walking to Tian Anmen Square, the Forbidden City and countless other attractions in the area."
125,,"I have stayed in a decent amount of cheap hotels in my lifetime so I can say that I have grown used to the lack of commodities and luxuries that come with more expensive finds. However, for being the most expensive cheap hotel I have ever stayed in, it was by far the least admirable. There were hairs in the sheets, rust in the bathtub, no hot water in the shower, BLOOD on the sheets, and the heat did not work (and anyone in chicago during the fall and winter nights can tell you that heat is a bare necessity!). When we asked for new sheets and more towels we were told that the linen closet was locked and that there was no way to get in without the key. In the morning, at about 12:05 pm, &quot;maintenance&quot; came pounding on our door demanding to us that we had to leave since checkout time was at 12. When we responded by assuring her we would be out in 5 minutes she yelled back at us, &quot;NOW!&quot; On our way out we asked to speak with the manager, and the same lady who claimed to be management told us that the manager was not present at the time....If you are looking for a cheap hotel or motel in the Chicago area try to stay away from the Abbott Hotel, and if you don't mind staying in a less-than-nice neighborhood be sure to check out the Chicago Lodge on W. Foster in 60640. It wasn't bad for $86--certainly seemed like a luxury motel compared to this crap hole."
126,,"After reading reviews on TA about this hotel, I was worried about the noise and elevators. I had absolutely no problem with either. We were on the 3rd floor facing the street, and I slept very soundly by the window. We stayed on weekdays though, so maybe weekends are not as good? Beds were very comfortable, and having a choice of pillows was nice.The staff was very helpful and curteous, and the room was spotless. I was expecting a small room (we booked with Hotwire for $99), but the room was huge, and we just had a standard one. The location was fantastic, too. We got one of the 'experience kits' but didn't have time to use it really (it was a nice plus anyway). Didn't try the bar or the restaurant.Overall a great stay in a very nice hotel. Very satisfied :)"
127,,"This is a great location, in terms of shopping and seeing the most attractive part of downtown Chicago. The hotel itself is relatively inexpensive for this part of town and for overall quality. There are a few aspects of the place that are a drawback, as has been noted in prior reviews. First, the place is hampered by its inadequate elevators. Even though it has five, you find yourself waiting a fair amount, including just getting to the lobby from the street level. Second, the rooms can be small. I had a corner room on the 11th floor, which measured roughly 9 x 11, leaving little room beyond that taken by the bed and desk. There was virtually no drawer space, and the closet and bathroom were also tight. For one person, it was acceptable, in a European/sailboat kind of way. The room itself was nicely done, with fairly good quality bedding and finishes. In talking with other guests, I got the impression that other rooms were somewhat larger, though not expansive.As for other aspects, breakfast was an anemic buffet priced at $15.00. The hotel has a large workout area on the top floor.Overall, I think the Allerton is a fairly good option, especially at the price."
128,,"I booked my stay via &quot;Last Minute Travel&quot; and was truly amazed at what a beautiful and historic property this is. The Staff was friendly and helpful, once you got past the bellmen. The bellmen / valet could work on their customer service just a little. My room was perfect. A standard room with a comfortable King bed, the bathroom was spoiless as had nice amenities. The carpet had a few worn areas, but the overall cleanliness of the room was tip top! The location is the best part of this property, the neighborhood is quite, but not too far from where you want to be. A true jem!"
129,,"Look if your looking for excellent service, cleanliness, location, value, and room then go to a 5 star!!! If you dont have five star money, then you dont [--] about staying at an Inn. Im a regular at the Amber Inn and Its the best hotel that you will find on the south side of chicago!!!!"
130,,"Brought the family along with me to Chicago for a conference at the Hilton. Been to Chicago many times &amp; hate staying at convention hotels--enjoy trying out new places. The Avenue was perfect for us. Location could not be beat--we were able to spend way too much time at the American Girl and Lego stores. The weather was unusually mild, so the 1-1/2 mile walk to the Hilton was pleasant. The $48 per day parking fee was a little steep (although not by Chicago standards), but we were able to take the car in and out as many times as we needed. Beds were EXTREMELY comfortable, shower pressure was okay, and the staff always greeted us with a smile. The kids were given small stuffed zebras when we checked in, which were a big hit. Only problem was that in the bathroom, we were able to hear conversations from the room next door as though the people were sitting right next to us. As for the predictable sirens and traffic noise, the 4-yr-old found that exciting and we were able to block it out when sleeping thanks to the nice loud fan on the air conditioning unit. Overall, very pleased &amp; would stay again!"
131,,"I moved to this hotel, after having a bad experience with a local hostel. My husband was a patient at St. Joseph's Hospital, and the Belair is only about 2 blocks away. It's an old hotel, but I found it to be comfortable and clean. I stayed in one of their overnight rooms, which had double bed, air conditioning, TV, and phone. These rent for $75/night. They also have rooms on a weekly or monthly basis, but these rooms lack TV and air conditioning. At $170-213/ week, they are a good deal, if you bring a fan. I think you can also pay a little extra for a fridge and microwave. The staff at the Belair were really nice, and the location, right next to Lincoln Park, was excellent."
132,,"We stayed at the Belden-Stratford last weekend for the first time. It was elegant, comfortable, friendly, amazing views, clean - and we hated to leave. We were also impressed with the wonderful continental breakfast and the amazing architecture and furnishings. The staff that we encountered, from check-in to maintenance people in the hall, were all friendly and helpful. It was a perfect location - across the street from Lincoln Park Zoo and walking distance to any type restaurant and shopping you could want. If you're lucky like us, you might be able to snag a good parking spot. Be sure to check out the beautiful view from the rooftop deck!"
133,,"On my previose (first-time) visit to Chicago, I booked three nights at the next-to-cheapest place I could find, which was a traveller's hostel a couple miles from the Bellwood, , where I had one fo the worst lodging expereinces of my life. If I only had known that for a few dollars more per night, I could have gotten a clean, private room at the Bellwood. This place was very clean, no sign of bugs, many amenities (tv, private bath and shower, phone in the room ... microwave, vending machines and laundry room also in the hotel). The room was great, the price very reasonable, location was great for me, the staff was freindly but not intrusive, , they gave me a courtesy call half an hour before check-out time. I stayed three nights and have no complaints about anything and I would cheerfully and enthusiastically recommend this place to anyone needing short-term, budget acommodations in Chicago. Compared to the hostel, where I will never set foot again, or recommend to anyone, this place made a world of difference in my overall enjoyment of my stay in the city, and I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Chi-town. Stay away from the hostels, go to the Bellwood instead."
134,,hotel was real nice staff was very friendly room was great an clean the resturant an bar are excellent would recomend an will stay again
135,,"We had booked a standard room, but were upgraded to a suite in their new building next door to the main hotel--very nice! Like an upscale studio apartment in a lovingly restored vintage building. Stylish and immaculate bathroom and kitchenette, hardwood floors, comfy couch and new bigscreen TV. Loved it. Staff were so nice. And cinnamon rolls from Ann Sather for breakfast--yum!"
136,,"With a web coupon, we got upgraded to a suite--large and roomy. All plumbing worked great and had hot water. WiFi not great. Room temp hard to get right, but had no noise from neighbors or the street. Skip the pizza and walk 3 blocks to Gino's East for great Chicago deep-dish. Large swimming pool--big enough to really swim. Helpful front desk, and free parking a big plus. We got a great car rental, so had the options of walking, driving, or a CTA pass--and we did all three."
137,,"I booked on travelocity so I got a really good deal on the room rate. The hotel is overall very nice. It is quiet and isolated and it does have an exclusive feel to it when you check in. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was very pretty. The view from the room was excellent with a combination of city lights and lake (we faced south). However, there were some dissappointments. The TV was ancient and did not work well. The access to the healthclub was an awesome advantange, however, it has extremely limited hours. They close at 9pm weeknights, 6pm on saturday, and they were not open at all on Sunday. The continental breakfast was diaappointing. It basically consisted of a bunch of day old bagels and pastries kept in the refrigerator and set out in the morning. The breakfast was not well stocked and was frequently empty and without coffee. Also, I tend to notice things about hygeine. It was a little concerning that the breakfast is stocked by the housekeepers while they are cleaning the guest rooms. I didnt really see the house keepers wash their hands or use gloves before handling the food on the breakfast bar. Overall, it was a good stay. Its well worth it if you get a steeply discounted price online, but i dont think i would pay the &quot;full rate&quot;."
138,,Not much to add to all the other reviews but wanted to share the fact that we liked this place. It is FAR less expensive than staying downtown. It might not be the best of areas (we really are no experts on that) but the Orange line is close and we did have the motel drive us there. The staff was very friendly and helpful. You're about a mile from Midway and 6 miles from downtown (takes about 25 minutes on the Orange line to to State/Lake). Better than average Continental Breakfast selection.
139,,"My husband and I chose this hotel because of its great location and great price. At first we were given keys to a room that would not open. We had to go back downstairs. They assigned us to a different room. We believe that they actually sent us to a room that was already in use! As we were walking in the hallway to the room, I jokingly told my husband that it seemed that the side of the hallway that our room was on felt like it was an interior room and wouldn't have windows. Unfortunately, I was correct. Instead it had two large skylights by the doorway. (The original room we were assigned to would have had windows!) There was a control on the wall for blinds on the two skylights, but unfortunately it only moved the blinds for one of the skylights. The rest of the room was quite small with a double bed. The bathroom was fairly large, but it had a large shower with no bathtub. I felt like it was a giant version of a bathroom from a cruiseship. The double bed was quite uncomfortable, and the pillows were horrible. Neither of us slept well at all either night. The temperature of the room didn't help things either.I noticed in an earlier review that someone had problems with getting heat in the room. We had the opposite problem. We could not cool down the room. I even set the thermostat at 55 degrees, and it was still quite warm. The hallway outside the room was much cooler! I also saw other reviewers complain about hearing doors slamming all of the time. It was an annoyance for us too. We ate breakfast at the attached restaurant and had a very good experience there. Service was great, and the food was quite good. You can't beat the location and price, but you get what you pay for. The room was very clean, but I would be willing to pay more for a decent night's sleep. Even my back was sore for a couple of days after staying there! As I understand, this is also a Club Quarters, a place businesses use for clients. If I were a client staying there, I wouldn't be very happy with the business sending me there!"
140,,This is literally a flop house. If this location is rated over 1 star there must be fake positive reviews.
141,,"Unbelievably dirty, smelly rooms, with torn, worn out furniture. Rude staff. It is NOT worth the price, even in Chicago."
142,,"Stayed for three nights with the UIC rate ($169/night).The good:+ Comfortable, clean, spacious room+ Conveniently located to UIC and 5 minutes from Taylor street (lots of restaurant options)+ Friendly staff+ Reasonable fitness room - ~6 pieces of cardio equipment and free weights with one bench+ Reasonably priced restaurant with good selection of options (for a hotel)The bad:+ Internet was wireless only and was not free - Marriott needs to differentiate itself by making this free across all of its brands. Internet access is now no longer the &quot;novelty&quot; it was two decades ago!+ No ability to turn up the heat - choice was either Air Conditioning (very cold) or no fan. I went with the latter..."
143,,"I stayed here because I got a super-low Priceline deal. However, everything about this hotel exceeded my expectations. The registration staff was very courteous, the wired Internet connection worked painlessly, and the room was nice and comfortable. I had a sore throat so I had bought a can of soup with me from the outside. Since the hotel had restaurants downstairs I was feeling a little awkward asking them about microwaving it. However I did with some hesitation and they not only let me microwave it in their restaurant but also gave me silverware to take to my room. And everything with a friendly smile. Overall, great customer service -- I am truly impressed!"
144,,"We chose this hotel because it was cheap but we should have payed a little more for something better! To put it into prospective, it's right next to Hooters... The hotel's pool had been closed for over a year, the bistro had been closed since 4/1/09 and the free wireless internet they advertise is only available in the entrance area! Their website advertises $50/night rates which is quite false (we payed over $100/night). Our room didn't have the advertised mini-fridge, hair-dryer (we had to go down and ask for it), or dvd player. A little on the scary side, we saw the front desk guy give a bunch of his drunk/high friends a key without them paying for it. I guess if you want to stay for the airport service, they apparently have a shuttle... but I still wouldn't recommend it!"
145,,"We had a very large group staying over Saturday, November 14th and Steve and Diane were absolutely amazing and very helpful making our stay as easy and comfortable as possible. We really appreciated their kindness and efforts. Thank you!"
146,,"I booked the hotel because of its proximity to Soldier Field (3/4 mile) and the cost was not too bad. I choose to upgrade to a King Deluxe room so we could have a view of Lake Michigan and the southern downtown area.The theme of the room is certainly the 70's with bright colors and some interesting designs...they certainly like Andy Warhol. Pros:Beautiful view of the parks; walking distance to Millenium Park and Art Museum; walking distance to Soldier Field and the Planetarium (all within 1 mile). Cabs were plentiful, so it was easy to go up and down Michigan Avenue to get to the Magnificent Mile when we got tired of walking. A lot of brochures for local attractions.Cons:Little heat/AC control...if the hotel had the heat on, you could not have A/C and vice versa. The pictures are very deceiving on the website: the room barely fit the king bed, and I could stand in the bathroom and touch both sides of it...turn 90 degress and touch both sides again. I had to hang over the toilet to close the door, and there was no exhaust fan. No directory for hotel services even though the website says they have room service during limited time frame. The employees were not the friendliest. One bartender only talked to us when he learned we were going to the Bears game, and the other one said nothing but to take our order. The bar manager (I think) was lingering around drinking Jack Daniels, but said nothing. The front desk staff were nice."
147,,"We are a family owned company, and I had a tight budget to run an exhibit at the McCormick center...so we chose the Cinatown Hotel Sro. You will find some helpful advice below. 1) Location, Locationa) We stayed at the Chinatown Sro Hotel for a week (7 days). There is no &quot;hotel parking&quot; so if you brought a car, you will be paying $10 a night to park in a supervised parking lot (a 2 min walk). You can however unload and load your car for 10 min outside the hotel.b) The hotel is less than a 3 min walk from the Red line train station Cermak/Chinatown. You can get on just about any other train to get anywhere you want from here. Fares are $2 each, and only 25c when you ride another train within 2 hrs.c) Excellent food. You can smell Chinatown before you see it. It smells like sweet and sour chicken and beer. My advice is to go for the resturants with the most god-awful gawdy lookings signs. King Wok is a good choice. Looks terrible on the outside, but upstairs you will be pleasantly surprised. Our theory was of they could afford the sign, they must have customers paying for it. You can also go just up the road to China square , which is a compound full of great resturants. Spoilt for choice.d) Lower crime rate. The Chinese generally look after their own neighborhood. I felt safer walking in Chinatown at night than in other &quot;dodgy&quot; areas of Chicago.e) 15 min walk to the McCormick center, you will save $20 a day in cab fares if you choose the healthy route. You can comprimise by grabbing a biscuit from the McDonalds along the way. 2) The Hotela) Friendly staff. The staff do speak English, just be patient, and were quite hepful. You will need to request extra towels to be given everyday, as their towels are cheap and Chinese, and soak up very little. Also, you may want to request a second room heater in cold weather (see details further on).b) The room keys. I still have to figure out how these worked. They are like pieces of tin that slide into the door handles. I have never seen this system before. If you pay by cash there is a deposit required for the room key, but not if you pay by credit card. c) The hotel internet only works downstairs. &quot;Free wireless&quot; is a joke, and the manager sid that it was becuase his server was too small to handle over 10 users on at one time... why offer it ?d) This hotel was built for Chinese people. The foyer looks nice, but once in the stairwell or corridor it is another story. They are tiny. I had to contort my body to avoid hitting my head in the stairwells, and it is a real trick with luggage, as there is no elevator. Luckily we were on the first floor.3) The Roomsa) VERY basic, I think I had more aminities in my Air Force barraks. The room view was a darn sight better than the two nasty alleys that these two windows fell open to. (I say fell, because neither worked correctly, and they both were very draughty when closed.... use your extra bath towels here!)b) Heat. (BYOSH) Bring your own space heater. Once is provided, but it is not enough. The hotel is draughty at night. Temps outside were about 32F, and it was pretty chilly inside. c) The beds are very small. I am 6'6&quot;. 250lb, and a completely covered the twin bed. I could not move left or right and my feet stuck out 1 foot over the end of the bed.d) The bathroom. Do not place wet towels on the towel rack. The exessive weight will make it pop off the wall.The showerhead is held by a plastic clamp, and it cannot be positioned to wash your body. The shower nozzle can be removed, however. In cold temps make sure that you dry off while the shower door is shut.e)TV. You get 7 channels. 2 are so fuzzy they look like snow storms. 2 are in Spanish and 1 in Chinese. So you are left with CNN and ESPN. The bottom line - If you want a cheap hotel in Chicago, near the McCormick center and you are not going to be bringing your customers back to the place, stay at the Chinatown Sro. It will save you lots of money in the long run. The hotel also makes a super reason to get out. You do not want to stay in your room for anything else other than bathing and sleep and for these two activities, it works as good as any US Army barrack."
148,,"My husband and I stayed here with 2 of our friends on a whim the night we went to a concert at the Metro. It was pretty close and we needed a place to stay. I am so happy we stumbled upon this hotel. Our room had two queen beds, but a hallway separated the beds so it was like having 2 rooms. It was great for saving money, but yet providing a little privacy being in the same room with the other couple. The front desk staff was friendly, our room and bathroom were huge and there was a really nice contintental breakfast in the morning. It's a little hard to find, we drove past it about 3 times, so keep your eyes peeled. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back if we're ever in the area and need to spend the night and have the money. It is a bit pricey for an unplanned night's stay."
149,,"Great value for the price. While the rooms are somewhat smaller than one might expect, it's the little things that count - especially when we are all trying to save a buck or two in this economy. Given the location, the room itself was the cheapest I had found. The rooms were clean and cozy comfortable. Now for the extras...Let's start with the unlimited free bottled water and then add the free wi-fi service on top of that. These days, other hotels are charging $10 for internet and $5 for each bottle of water. It all adds up. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There are several fast food and sit down restaurants nearby. The hotel is located right off of the Orange and Brown lines. Again, saving you money in the end."
150,,"Club Quarters on Wacker Drive would be my first choice on a return visit to Chicago. The hotel is really well located. The bus stop for the trolley tour is literally straight across the road and if you want to take a river boat tour (which I would highly recommend), you simply have to go down the steps to the river from there. It's right on the magnificent mile so you don't have to walk too far with heavy shopping bags. I booked this hotel very late (about a week before my planned trip) and while all the other hotels were extortionately expensive, this one was not nearly as bad (relatively speaking). The hotel has valet parking which costs around $26 a night, if I recall correctly. I booked the smallest available room which I think was the club size room. This room is quite small but by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. In fact, it was definitely just the right size for me. I was only travelling with an overnight bag and I think if I had a large suitcase, the room might have been too small. I would recommend that a couple travelling with 2 suitcases take a larger room. The room was immaculately clean and the bed was so comfortable. I can honestly say I've never had such a good night's sleep in a hotel. Considering the location, I was expecting the room to be noisy but I had no problems whatsoever in that regard. There are open access computers in the lobby and there are even printing facilities there so that people can check-in for flights online and print their boarding cards. Overall, I was really happy with my choice of this hotel and there is no question about where I will be staying when I go back to Chicago."
151,,"For the price I paid it was an excellent stay -- 3 nights in Chicago. The room was a good size, the check-in staff was courteous and very nice, but the check-out staff was rude and unfriendly. Parking with in and out privileges were $25/night which is unheard of in the city. Definitely will come back again."
152,,"We stayed at the Comfort Suites during the Festival of the Lights on Michigan Avenue. We chose this spot because of the closeness to the events. Our suite, which was huge, had a patio with the most amazing view! It allowed us to avoid fighting the crowds because we could watch the parade from the comfort of our balcony. The service was friendly and prompt, and the beds were comfortable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. We will be returning."
153,,"I arrived to find that workers at the Congress have been on strike for SIX YEARS and to stay there is crossing a picket line. I couldn't believe that there was no heads up about the strike before I arrived in Chicago... &quot;Today, Chicago housekeepers earn $14.60 an hour, while the Congress Hotel still pays 2002 wages – just $8.83 an hour. &quot;"
154,,"This is a superb hotel. The rooms are huge, including a luxurious bathroom. It is clean and service is first rate. Breakfast was excellent (and complimentary for Hilton Honors members). Hotel is in a good location, and is connected to a mall, which I imagine would be a great asset in the Chicago winter. Next time I go to Chicago, I will stay here for sure."
155,,"Spent one night at the Courtyard-Downtown and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the staff and accomodations. From the doorman to the maids, all of the staff made our trip extra special. Although the rooms were a little on the small size, they were clean, quiet and comfortable. Hotel food was not all that special, but there are many restaurants within walking distance. Bathrooms were clean. This is a no-complaint hotel. Price for parking is outrageous. ($45/night)"
156,,"I had the fortune to spend the weekend in Chicago and chose to stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Downtown / Magnificent Mile. It's important to note that we were visiting the Second City for the 2009 Bank of America Chicago Marathon, so the hotel was full and the city was packed with runners and spectators. My wife and I experienced tremendous customer service during the length of our stay at the hotel. The check-in process was seamless and the friendliness of the staff was evident in our very first interactions. The great service continued every step of the way during our stay -- from the front desk to the bellhop to the housekeepers. Everyone we interacted with was happy to help and treated us very well.The location was incredible as well. We were in walking distance to major shopping on the Magnificent Mile (1/2 block from the entrance to the hotel) and hundreds of fine restaurants. We were also very close to public transportation and used it to access the different neighborhoods that make Chicago such a great weekend destination. The only complaint I have in terms of amenities would be the Starbucks located within the hotel. It was a very small location and was always jam packed. We attempted to grab coffee on two separate occasions, only to be 'turned away' from the long line. Instead, we opted to get our caffeine fix at the Dunkin' Donuts located 100 yards from the hotel. On a more positive note, the free wireless internet was fast and easy to access (a huge perk in our book!).The room we stayed in was very large and included a king size bed and full sofa. It was very clean and had a very nice layout. The bathroom was also very large and clean. The room, however, is in need of updating/renovation. The first addition I would suggest is a flat screen LCD TV.What did I like best? Friendly Staff; Location; Free Wireless InternetWhat did I like least? Old school TV (need an LCD with HD); inaccessibility of the Starbucks"
157,,"We had a late flight into Midway and needed a place to sleep before a day of fun in Chicago, so I booked a room through Priceline, and ended up at the Courtyard. For the price I paid, it was a great value. If I had paid full price, I might have wanted more pizazz. But the room was roomy and clean, with very nice comfortable beds and bedding. I left behind my eyeglasses, on the floor of all places, and the staff was very helpful in getting them back to me in perfect condition. No noise problem, even being close to the airport. Shuttle service from the airport was great, even with our 1 AM arrival. A number of eating options attached to the hotel, or within walking distance. Features I saw but did not use: Nice looking (smallish) indoor pool and very basic fitness room."
158,,"I recently stayed two nights at the Crowne Plaza. It is your typical business hotel. I was in an executive suite which was very nice but there was not adequate lighting in the room and a little note of explanation that they were in the process of installing more lighting in the rooms. There was a fair amount of noise from the freeway the hotel sits right next to. I guess that's why they had earplugs in the room. The hotel dining room was okay for breakfast. There are several good Greek restaurants close by and a grocery store across the street. As far as the downtown area like Michigan Avenue, this is a good 20 minute walk if not more. I didn't really mind it except when it started raining. Be prepared to have to take a taxi to go just about anywhere from the hotel. I will say the front desk staff were very nice and very helpful when asked directions, etc. The bell staff were very good about storing luggage and arranging a town car back to the airport which was the same price as a regular taxi. Other than the lighting problem the room was comfortable except a little freeway noise."
159,,"We booked through travelocity and paid $130 a night including breakfast. The rooms are small and modern. Bed very comfortable. Close to everything. Bar on top floor, restaurant in lobby, both good. Staff very friendly."
160,,"stayed here for 2 nights. good location with plenty of restaurants nearby. staff helpful although not even their service could prevent the free wifi fiasco with printing. internet cafe nearby solved the issue. easy transport on the el with a transit pass only 2 blocks away. get a quiet room at the back - we didnt and the noise from staff in the side alley having a cigarette til past midnight was unpleasant. the big breakfast buffet was fab - waffles, breads, pastries, cereals, coffee, juices, fruit - yummy! good value and we loved chicago. hotel has apologised for the noise and wifi issues and promised me a free upgrade next time - shame its such a long way from the uk."
161,,"We have just returned from a stay at this hotel which is situated on East Delaware Place. Although a little dated it was a bargain we had a suite with a bedroom with kingsize bed, bathroom, kitchen with full oven and fridge freezer and a large Diner/lounge with dining table settee and chairs a desk and cable TV. The situation was excellent close to many attaractions, shopping centres, cinema and around the corner from a Underground Station.There was a bonus of a minimarket less than 100yds away. We stayed in May and paid $78.00 per night for the room plus tax!! It is on the same road as 4 star hotels a safe area with many restaurants close by"
162,,"This hotel is close to the magnificent mile. Check in was swift. Room was spacious, especially for a city hotelroom. Nice view. Very comfortable beds. There's is a nice breakfast restaurant across the street (The Egg Cafe)."
163,,"This is a great hotel if you are going to be in the downtown area and don't mind walking a bit. You can always take a cab, but Chicago is a great walking city if you are able to do so. The hotel is also in walking distance to Michigan Ave. shopping and restaurants. The Red Line is a couple of blocks away which makes it ideal to ride the train up to Lincoln Park and Wrigleyville. The room was quite nice and spacious. Upon moving to Chicago from Texas, I stayed in this particular hotel for a week before moving into an apartment. The hotel staff were very helpful in giving me directions and suggestions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. The rooms are much bigger than most hotels in the area, and the price is pretty reasonable. Further, free breakfast and happy hour are great bonuses."
164,,"My wife and I stayed at this Embassy Suites for one night while attending our reunion in Chicago. We arrived about a half hour before check-in and did not get a room until about 45 minutes after check-in time. They gave us a nice room on the top floor so I guess I can't complain. The complimentary happy hour was very busy, but the bar tenders kept up pretty well. The room was very nice with a nice view. The complimentary breakfast was pretty nice, but again it was pretty busy. The breakfast was not as nice as some of the smaller Embassy Suites I have stayed at, but still pretty good.We parked at a nearby parking garage for $31. You can valet park at the hotel for $39. We drove around a bit but couldn't find anything less than $31 for the night.I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I needed to stay in downtown Chicago."
165,,"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. I was there for a week at the end of September 2008. The place was as advertised, safe, clean, and practical (desks, lounge, kitchen with utensils, bedding, towels, etc.). Room service was provided once a week but so what if I had to make my own bed and empty my trash. The access to local transportation was fantastic and that included access to O'hare. You can walk to the mall if you want to. There's no pool but access to Bally's fitness center was included in the price of the room. The staff (with the exception of Barry(?)) was very helpful and very polite. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat!"
166,,"Hotels in Chicago are pricey, and I paid $115 to stay here (which was low if you wanted to be in a safe area &amp; a clean place to stay). The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, extremely close to the airport (10 min, free, shuttle ride because the local hotels share the service), within walking distance to restaurants, internet worked great, relatively quiet. No complaints."
167,,"The location for this hotel is great. It is right off of Michigan Avenue about 5 blocks from the Hancock center. The lobby is nice as are the people who work at the hotel. The rooms leave something to be desired. While clean they are not updated and provide the bar minimum of comforts. There is no lotion in the bathroom. The towels are as thin as paper. The blanke is a thick sheet. The workout room is pathetic. It does come with a decent breakfast. My rate was not that cheap (around $200 a night). For that much money I would expect a little more. My conference was at the Drake and I could have stayed in absolute luxury for $240 a night. This is a god place if all you care about is locationa nd you want zero, and I mean zero, frills."
168,,Stayed 3 nights in early November for a girlfriend trip! Booked a suite and had incredible views. I don't think the beds are as comfortable as Westins..etc. Check in was fast and easy. I found ALL the staff to be super friendly! We were on the 21st floor...two bedded suite with a nice bathroom. Our room was quiet. I used the Fairmont Fit program and enjoyed that. I wouldn't recommend the Aveda kit....not worth the $10 they charge. DIning. We dined outside the hotel. We luved the Chicago Chop House. Huge portions and we brought our own wine from California...$20 corkage fee. Mike Ditka's had a great fall menu...very busy restaurant. Won't go back to Restaurant on the 95th at Sears Tower....not that great of food. LOVED the brunch at David Burke's. $35 and a 2 1/2 hour meal! Amazing and fun! We had a tour of the meat locker and that was interesting. Went to the Redhead piano bar. Go early to sit at piano. VERY busy after 8:30 PM. Saw a play down in the theater district. Had drinks at the Hard Rock Hotel....cucumber vodka drink....yummy! Took the Wendella river and lake cruise....$23. Very interesting and glad we did it. Next time will hit the Marshall Fields museum. Shopping is huge! BIggest hits were at Bloomies and Marshalls.
169,,"I was waiting to write review to ask my son the name of the check in clerk whose name escapes me. He epitomizes this great city and we had a nice chat or two during our stay.I also saw him leaving a party laughing upon their check in. This says alot about the hotel and your first impression.My son loved the room and location as I let him choose which Starwood property as we were using points. Yes we could have stayed at Westin or the Towers but this was a great choice. With points you only get a single bedded room but they upgraded us to a two bed even though I offered to pay for a cot. The pillows were the most comfortable I've ever used and the beds were twin I believe and extremely comfortable. I don't understand why americans have to have hugh beds...this was perfectly satisfactory.The room had a mini fridge, great for storing drinks from the nearby trader joes downstairs along with a close by 711. It's hard to find a badly placed property in Chicago, and this one is right in the thick of things and can't imagine a better located hotel. We also enjoyed the spa after a long day of walking and the fact the hotel isn't too snooty and you can relax and enjoy the facilities.The view was nice, one of the things I look for when booking, of a pink restaurant but we didn't have time to try. We were fixated on trying all the pizza joints.Again, being high season and crowded we still got excellent service."
170,,I was awakened at 3:30 AM with water leaking from the ceiling and dripping on me and the bed. Management staff was very unresponsive to the problem. The ceiling had several poor patch jobs and was peeling in other spots. I'd stay away from this hotel brand.
171,,"Very convenient for the aiport with free shuttle bus every 20 minutes. You can get the blue line train to downtown Chicago at the airport; however, it will take about an hour.Bar and restaurant good. Rooms spacious.Downside: the quality of the bedding was very poor. Sheets were thin and not ironed leaving me convinced they had not been changed after the previous occupant had left. Also found the previous occupants dirty socks in the wardrobe which added to my concerns!Corridors need a little freshening up as they had a musty smell. If you have laundry done, don't expect it to be delivered to your room - you will need to collect it yourself.Overall, a hotel convenient for the airport. Sheraton in name only!"
172,,"Great hotel, great pool and spa, great service, REALLY great views."
173,,"I was in Chicago for a conference and research at the University of Chicago, and, of course, found time to see some of the sights with my husband. We wanted more room and comfort than the average budget hotel for our 5-day stay, and we certainly got it -- and at a budget price! We were walking distance to Union Station, and on several major bus routes. The room was only technically a studio, as the bedroom was separated from the living room by a 3/4-wall. The kitchen was well-stocked with the basic utensils, but remember to pick up some salt and pepper and napkins in the grocery store on the ground floor. The building also houses a McDonald's and a Thai restaurant (mediocre at best, but handy). Our only minor quibble was that they cleaned the room the day before we left, without notice."
174,,"I checked in and after seeing the room and hearing sirens from the fire station next door, checked back out and found another hotel. The room was spacious, but was in serious need of renovation. The furniture was worn, chipped and stained. The ceiling had a large water stain. The bathroom was really shabby, peeling wall paper, stains on the countertop and mirror. The only things in the room that appeared new were the bed and flat screen t.v. The manager said they will be renovating soon - I would skip this hotel until that happens. Unfortunately they cannot do anything about the proximity to the fire station, so if you are a light sleeper, you might want to avoid this one completely."
175,,"Just stayed for 5 nights at the Hampton Majestic - started our break going to Jersey Boys, right next door - what a beautiful theatre! Our room was the quietest we have ever had, and the beds were extraordinary - we slept like logs. Breakfast was surprisingly nice, with great coffee, and then we would set out for the day. Not only could we walk everywhere in the vicinity of the Loop, but stops for all the metro lines, were around the corner. I just don't think the hotel could be more conveniently located. It was our first trip to Chicago, and staying at the Hampton allowed us to make the most of our visit."
176,,"rooms were imaculately clean, very nicely furnished, staff bent over backwards for anything we requested! free guitars in room is incredible, my boyfriend had a blast! and the in-room breakfast rocked my world... very much worth the price! we hope to go back again!"
177,,"We booked a week straight at the end of June 2009 thru hotels.com, me and my girlfriend on a month long trip all over the U.S.First of all, the POSITION. It is located in good Andersonville, near one of Chicago's best places to see, Wrigleyville. Safe place, with lots of young people, elder women, friendly faces. And the more you get close to the Wrigley Field the more the places look cool. The complaints about its location and how long it is to get to transports are exaggerated, in my opinion. Just outside the motel you have the bus that takes you in less than 2 minutes (seriously) to the EL stop &quot;Bryn Mawr&quot; or directly to Wrigleyville. Mind that with the cheap CTA card you can take bus and metro as much as you want, at no charge. As for the distance between Bryn Mawr and the Heart i'd like to point out that the taxi we took upon arrival, not knowing the actual distance from the motel (just a straight road!), took us around the neighborhood for a while, just to build up on fares.. jackaxxs. Maybe it's the reason why some people complaint so much about the distance.THE ROOM was superclean, the kind of cleaniness that makes you come back tired, after a day of sightseeing, make a shower and go around the room, barefeet. Not bad. The free continental BREAKFAST was another welcome feature. Lots of tasty donuts, fruit, oatmeals, good coffee, and juice. We're italians and wanted exactly this type of food in the morning, just to start you up. Good!The (latin?) woman at the front desk is rather unpolite, not very gentle. But who cares, i mean, in a motel you don't need that much of interaction, anyway.And at the front desk you could also meet the chicagoan guy! I don't know if he runs the motel himself or he just works there but he was really polite and willing to help you. He showed us bus stops, gave us tips on directions and was just a pleasant local to talk to. Kind enough we wanted to say goodbye upon leaving.All in all, we had a great experience at the heart! Definitely a place to look for, if you're travelling on a budget (Chicago hotels can be expensive) and want a very clean, safe, place to crash after a day around. The fact that this review sounds like a pamphlet from the motel should tell you a lot about the experience!"
178,,"I was just at the Hilton for four days for a Conference. I always roommate with a friend, and this is my first experience with having two bathrooms, and two closets. That makes a lot of things easier! The room was large and clean and the beds very comfortable. The towels were large and wonderfully plush. I thought the service was good and the staff very pleasant. Now the little things that seemed so odd: I drink tea. I used up the two tea bags provided in the room on the first day, and they were never replaced, though the cups were regularly replaced. Fortunately I bring along some tea myself, so it wasn't a hardship but an interesting oversight. There are only two lamps in the room -- one over the desk and one between the beds. They were barely sufficient for a room that size. Also, there was no way one of us could have stayed up to read, etc., without the bedside light disturbing the other person. Finally, whoever got the idea that elevators need televisions in them should be fired. If there must be televisions, at least turn them down! I was there for the National Communication Association - 6000 of us. We talk to each other, even in elevators -- especially in elevators! In every elevator, the sound on the television was so loud you had to raise your voice to talk. By some coincidence, on the last day every time I got in the elevator a commercial (yes, a commercial!) for some kind of welding service was running, backed by heavy metal-style music. A woman got on the elevator and asked, alarmed, &quot;Is this a new style of elevator music?&quot; If only......"
179,,"Room is comfortable but small.Parking is expensive, $45 per night for valet parking.Typical American breakfast buffet, no much variety."
180,,"I live in the area and stayed downtown for business. This hotel had updated rooms, very comfy beds, reasonable sized bathrooms and very good service. I am sensitive to odors, like Febreze covering up bad smells. Hilton Garden Inn smelled fresh and clean and had comfortable rooms. You can hear ambulance/police car sounds at night, which is typical of all Chicago area hoteld. Staff seemed friendly. I felt safe, and Weber Grill reataurant on site is a great place to eat. No probablem getting a cab in the morning when it was raining. I would recommend and stay again. Most downtown hotels have smaller rooms (especially in older hotels). This location is very good for visitors. Tons of places to eat within walking distance."
181,,"So we've been in and out of hotel rooms for the past month after being 'in between' apartments on my part and this is the best one thus far (1. hilton, 2. doubletree LAST 3. allegro). The room is absolutely huge. 2 double doors that lead to a giant bedroom with another tv, a living room with a flat panel, big bathroom, wet bar...not to mention the ridiculously cool indoor pool on the roof...Do you know how rare that is? Doubletree advertised a roof...that was closed for the winter. And the couch folds out into a bigger bed. And theres a microwave.And its right next to the Hancock building giving us a gorgeous view (the fact that they put us on the top floor didn't hurt either). We were planning on going out and enjoying the city but got such a kick out of our room that we went to Jewel like 2 teenagers and bought $30 worth of frozen buffalo wings to eat/watch tv with all night while snuggling on our folding couch.I can't believe this was the cheapest hotel we got because this was BY FAR the best I've ever stayed in. I wish I can get the same rate again but its just not showing up. :("
182,,"I stayed there for 4 days including weekends. It was located right next to Chicago river, right next to the Merchandise mart. 1. location. Near North. I had little hard time finding the building entrance at night, the door connecting through the m-mart was closed, so I had to drag my bags and walk around the building. After then, I enjoyed walking down the street and looking at the boats. Once you cross the bridge, you can walk to the Chicago theater, ABC 7, department stores, borders bookstore and coffee shops. I had to use UPS and FEDEX service, they were very close and friendly. 2. hotel.It was just average. the room was clean and the view was great looking down the river. but the overall facilities were average.3. restaurant.I had dinner at the restaurant ordered the soba noodle salad and lobster main dish. but the noodle was overcooked, salad was right from a package, and the lobster was okay but not impressed with the risotto."
183,,"We used the Holiday Inn to park our car while we flew to California. It worked out very well. This hotel is in a complex of hotels on Cicero just south of Midway Airport. They share a shuttle service, and it works out very well. Departures are scheduled every 30 minutes, sometimes more. Pick-ups are more frequent than that, outside the baggage claim.There is a fairly typical sports bar off the lobby which serves pretty good food. The crowd is a mix of business happy hour and hotel guests. We felt comfortable with our 5 year old and 10 year old having dinner there. Same atmosphere you'd find at a Chili's or a BW3.Park and Fly Package was a great value! When we compare it to discount parking at Midway, it was like we got a hotel room for $49. It takes a lot of the stress out of your departure flight morning, too."
184,,"I stayed here with my fiancé and another couple in the beginning of September 2009. We were in Chicago for a tradeshow at the McCormick, and all the hotels in the city were overpriced ($2-300 a night). I got an AMAZING offer for this hotel through a booking site ( 2 hotel rooms and a car for 3 nights/4 days for about $400).The hotel is about 5 minutes from the airport, but we didn't hear any planes while we were in the room. The hotel is also right off the highway to get into the city and other areas in greater Chicago, which was convenient. The city is about a 20-30 minute drive, depending on traffic.The hotel is nicer than all other Holiday Inns that I've been to - there's a proper foyer and people at the reception desk, as well as a bar/restaurant downstairs. Our rooms were clean and spacious, and the bathroom was clean as well. We were very pleased with everything overall. We had a microwave in our room and our friends had a fridge (but neither rooms had both - strange). There's no safe.Parking is free and there is ample parking at the front and back of the building. The area seemed safe too. Oh, and there was free internet too!"
185,,We stayed at this hotel last night and a few minutes after I got in the bed I started to feel itchy. Now that it's after dark I feel itchy and keep scratching an i have raised bumps all over I took a shower but will need to take another one I feel so nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were too tired to tell the staff that night so we just all tried to cram onto the hide-a-bed couch without pillows &amp; blankets because we didn't want them but left the sheets on. Told them this morning and they said they'd look into it. The staff/maintenance guys were changing out air conditioners in units and getting mad at each other I felt like I was in the way when I walked out of the room. I didn't see any bugs but I am still itching and I wasn't until I went to this hotel last night!! It's also kind of noisy/on a busy street.
186,,"Great hotel for our first trip to Chicago. We came up for the Harry Potter exhibit at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry - we highly recommend that for any HP fans (take the Blue Line to Jackson and then hop the #10 bus all the way to the museum)! Easy to find (right off highway 250), 1/2 a block from the Blue Line subway - so convenient! 10-15 minute walk to the Sears (er - Willis) Tower, and a little further on to downtown. The restaurant (Aurelio's) was pretty good - definitely go for the breakfast buffet! Remember to stop at the front desk for vouchers if you want to take advantage of the Kids Eat Free thing. Nice clean room, standard bathroom (but clean) and wonderfully firm beds. Fair warning, though, even if the person taking your reservation says it's okay, if you book a 2-double room, a rollaway is not permitted - apparently it's a fire hazard. The front desk employee said I'd have to upgrade to a Junior Suite to have a rollaway - $50 more per night. Oh and parking was pretty steep (but standard for the city) - skip the valet service and park yourself in the well-lit lot behind the hotel. Valet was $30 a day, we paid $23 for the weekend (24 hour $18+ 12 hour $5)."
187,,"I met my girlfriends in Chicago for the weekend for a birthday celebration and stayed at Homewood Suites. I wasn't sure what to expect, but we loved it. The rooms are huge, with a full kitchen, a pullout sofa and a monster king sized bed. Bathrooms are large enough for 3 women to get ready to go out at night without stepping on each other. The staff was great. We dined at Table 52, Art Smith's (Oprah's former chef) restaurant and stopped at Le Colonial one night and walked there easily. The first night we were a bit tired, so simply walked across the street to PF Chang's - who also provides the room service at the hotel. The entrance to Nordstrom is just across the street from the hotel's front door and for discount shopping, walking to the loop to shop on State Street is an easy morning jaunt over the river. All in all, a good price for a nice hotel with a charming staff and a magnificent location. Internet and breakfast are included in the room rate. I'll definitely come back and bring the kids next time...loads of families were staying there that weekend."
188,,"The Hotel 71 in Chicago is very well positioned near Wrigley Tower and on the River at Wabash street. It was easy walk to everywhere I needed to be. The room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Bed was comfortable, and the heating and cooling system worked well. The bathroom was clean, shower was good with plenty of pressure. In room coffee was tasty, and the desk and wifi were a nice touch. The view of the river was great! As an added bonus, the windows open, so a little fresh air was a welcome thing, as the room did have the odor of smoke. (Hotel was full due to conventions in town. I was not able to get a non-smoking room) Overall the room was nice, however I do believe it had not been refurbished in a while. There was shoddy repair work from the removal of the in bathroom hairdryer, and some wallpaper was peeling. Once again, minor issues, but hopefully that will be rectified soon. Elevators were swift, and the doormen and front desk staff were very friendly, quick with several recommendations, and very attentive to any extra needs. It will be better when the full restaurant is back opened, instead of the bar area being only option. The Hotel 71 does get kudos for a good breakfast selection for grab and go!The modern design of the hotel is a nice break from the chains, and I found the lobby area inviting and comfortable. It was a good area to sit and read the paper, and watch the comings and goings as I waited for other members of my party. I will definitely stay at the Hotel 71 in Chicago again, should business take me there again! I would also use it for a pleasure trip, as it is in a good location."
189,,"I booked Hotel Blake for my recent visit to Chicago for a conference/vacation. The hotel was in a convenient location for the conference and super dining options (especially Tamarind). The hotel was superbly styled...fun and contemporary, rooms were very comfortable. Breakfast was simple but a wonderful start to the day. Staff was very pleasant and very helpful. Normally, I haven't traveled to Chicago much but having stayed at Hotel Blake I may make more impromtu trips to Chicago knowing I'll have a comfortable, fun place to stay."
190,,"I stayed at this hotel for a business trade show Oct 4th and 5th - originally planning to spend just one night. The staff was extremely accomodating - the door man was exceptionally pleasant &amp; the place was clean and well maintained. The building itself is old, the rooms are nothing fancy, but the service was great and there was a full breakfast buffet included in the price. A great location &amp; a great value."
191,,"We found this hotel via hotwire - aka we took a gamble - and it was great. The room we had was very small (as in tiny), but very clean and nice. Nothing to fancy but you felt very comfortable there. Our greatest need on our 3 night stay was location. And this was located pretty close to the Mile which is what we wanted. I would not have paid their normal prices online as that would have been too much, but if you find a cheap deal then go for it."
192,,"A great place to stay! Check in was a breeze. We got there early and the staff was very helpful, changing us from a non-smoking queen room to a king smoking room! The room wasn't ready yet so they held our bags for us and recommened places in the area to grab a drink &amp; bite to eat. We came back and went to our room on the 4th floor just off of the elevator. I was worried that it would be very noisy, but it was not! :) The room was so comfortable and had everything we needed. I love the shower, lots of pressure &amp; hot water. The hotel is located close to the action. Tons of places to eat, drink &amp; shop close by. The Red Line is a block away and there were always taxis out front if you don't like to walk. You can take a short stroll and the Magnificent Mile is right there to do all the shopping you could want. There is plenty to see &amp; do within blocks of the hotel. The hotel is located in a very residential area with beautiful old brownstones. The area was well lit and seemed totally safe to walk in. I would recommend the Indigo to anyone!"
193,,"This hotel is quite a steal - great prices with some of the best hotel service I've had in awhile. Greeted everytime I entered, all hotel staff acted as if it was a pleasure to serve me. The rooms are cozy yet have plenty of room. And the rates are excellent. They even have complimentary wine in the evenings. Close to trains, Millenium park. Highly recommend. If I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here again."
194,,"This is a nice hotel. It is &quot;close&quot; on a lot of categories so if you get a good rate you should chose this as a possibility. Here is what close means. The hotel is close to being very good, close to good neighborhood close to having very good service. Would this be the first choice - close but no. It is a pleasant hotel. the rooms are nice. the neighborhood is 3 blocks from nice. Having House of Blues 20 feet away is close to being quiet. Overall I liked the hotel and paid $160 a night and would stay again at that rate or lower. Because the hotel is not great, not great service, not a great heighborhood, not great sound proofing I would not stay at $200. Hope this helps."
195,,"True. It was kinda old, but all the amenities worked except for the Wi-Fi which was absent the first 2 days of my 5 day stay. The dinner is really nice, too. The hotel provides really good value for the price."
196,,"As many before me have mentioned, this is a great hotel for the convention center - you don't even have to go outside. If the reason for your trip is a convention, then I think it's the best possible choice. I attended a conference in Chicago and stayed at this hotel as well as the Hyatt Regency on Wacker (the Hyatt Regency Chicago). I think of the two the McCormick Place Hyatt is more modern and has probably been more recently updated. The room was very clean, the room design was more current, and the bathroom fixtures were newer. On the other hand, I think the service at this hotel was perhaps not as serene as at the Hyatt on Wacker - I had longer waits to speak with the concierge/front desk at the McCormick Place Hyatt, and I got some &quot;I don't knows&quot; from the front desk in response to questions they should have been able to accommodate. One example was when we inquired regarding the Metra, which is the closest public transportation option to our hotel - they didn't have any schedules on hand and could not tell us anything about using it. Another example - I left an item in my room when I checked out, and one of my colleagues who was still in the room brought it down to be mailed to me and filled out a FedEx slip with my name and address. Due to a lack of communication between the front desk and the packing departments, however, calls to the front desk about my item the next day got a response that they didn't know anything about it. After calling back again, and speaking to shipping, where it turns out my item would have languished until I managed to get connected to someone who knew something about it, they finally took my credit card information and sent my item, which I have since received. I am inclined to attribute some of this confusion to the fact that many people were checking out the day I did, and I had confidence that this issue would eventually be resolved satisfactorily, but I think the front desk could strive to emulate the focus on service that the Hyatt on Wacker demonstrated to me during my stay there.That said, for attending a conference in Chicago I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
197,,"Old charm at a good price. Not a cookie cutter hotel. Pleasant walk to Brown Line. We were able to park the car free in their lot during the week with no problem. Only had to pay Sat night in the lot across the street for $15. Breakfast had many choices for a complimentary meal. We did have a room looking at a brick wall but that was more than OK. No noise. Our last stay in Chicago had many nights interupted by traffic because, well, who doesn't need a McDonalds at 2am?"
198,,"This was my first time in Chicago and my friend and I were a little uncertain about this hotel before we got there. It was amazing. The staff (especially LaTonya and Dan the bartender) could not have been more helpful. Everything was taken care of for us, and the location is perfect. The value of this hotel far exceeds the others I checked out. We were so sad to leave!"
199,,"I was a guest at the InterContinental during the May 2009 Society of Hospitalist Medicine Conference- the venue hotel was booked. I enjoyed my stay immensely. The staff was very attentive-- especially during the rainstorm which greeted me upon my arrival. They were there with umbrellas to keep me dry as the cab driver unloaded my luggage. My room had a problem with the thermostat, but the front desk was very receptive when I brought it to their attention. Despite the busy downtown activity, the staff gave excellent individual attention. I will return to the InterContinental whenever my travel plans lead me to Chicago."
200,,"I stayed for 5 nights, from Nov 9-14, room 1004.It's a 2 queen beds room, booked on the hotel website, with an internet special offer (119$/night including taxes).The room was very clean, nicely furnished, not very large (as expected, there was no desk), but with lots of amenities, comfortable beds.The main room lights are above the beds: they are either ON (and they make quite a bit of light if one person wants to sleep), or they're OFF (then you can't read at all).I broke a mug on the very first day, and we were left with only another mug for the remaining 4 days.These are about the only (minor) faults I can find with James hotel in Chicago.The location is perfect, the price was very cheap, the staff is friendly. Most of all the room is clean and the beds are great. Free wi-fi in the rooms.I asked for a late check out (from 12 to 1pm), I was given another extra hour and some more time, with no hassle.I'll certainly go back if in Chicago."
201,,"My work booked this hotel due to the fact that it is basically across the street from our corporate office. The hotel was easy to find, in great location, and the people were wonderful. The view from my 5th floor room was of other windows and covered parking - would have like to see some of the sights. My only real complaint is that I needed a refrigerator for my medication. Most hotels all feature mini fridge/microwave. This hotel did not have a mini-fridge. And since the room was paid for by someone else, I could not add one. It turned out not to be too big of a deal as I filled the ice bucket up with ice and kept my medication on it all night but I had no way of refreezing my ice packs to keep in my bag. That being my only issue, I would definately stay here again as the proximity to the &quot;EL&quot; and office can't be beat."
202,,"I stayed at this La Quinta for 2 nights in April. The room was fantastic... clean, up-to-date furnishings, spatious. It's too bad that the management and staff aren't up to par.About 6 hours after checking out, I realized that I left a number of (very expensive) clothing items in the closet and bathroom hanger. I immediately called the front desk and was informed that the cleaning staff had left for the night. She said my items were probably locked away and to call back the next day. My boyfriend called early the next morning and was told that my items were nowhere to be found. I called later to speak with the &quot;acting&quot; manager and was treated VERY poorly. She reminded me that they were not responsible for items left, never apologized, and was extremely short and dismissive to me. She acted as if I was a bother to her and audibly sighed several times. This was unnecessary, as I had never once raised my voice or asked for a discount/reinbursement of any kind. A simple &quot;I'm sorry this happened. We'll keep our eyes out for your items.&quot; would have been sufficient. This was a disappointing end to what would have been a wonderful stay."
203,,"The Majestic Hotel is located on the outskirts of Chicago, just about a five minute drive to Navy Pier. It's in a nice quite neighborhood. The rooms are spacey, with mini-refrigerators and microwaves. The evelevator was being repaired and we had one friend who needed a room adjustment. The staff moved all her things to a new room. They were extremley nice and very helpful. The rooms were really clean, beds were great and they have this one blanket that is so soft. The price was really inexpensive."
204,,"We went to Chicago with 3 other couples and stayed at this hotel. We couldn't have chosen a better location and the hotel was so nice!! Extremely good value for the price!! Steve (the door man) was a godsend! He makes that hotel what it is! He was always so helpful with getting us cabs, even got us a humer limo one night at a cheaper rate it would have ben to take a cab!!! All the staff there are very accomodating!Would definetly return to this hotel."
205,,"As a lover of Marriot hotels, I booked two rooms for a mother/darughter weekend to see The Color Purple. My mom, grandma and cousin arrived that afternoon. They didn't hesitate to call me to rave about how beautiful the hotel was. &quot;Great pick,&quot; they said. Later that evening, I flew in to Midway then caught the trolley straight to the hotel. It was the best experience- fast and convenient. There are several restaurants nearby both fast food and dine in. If you're looking for a taste of Chicago Giordano's is down the street and they deliver. Another plus is that to get downtown is a ten minute drive, much closer than O'Hare. Would definately stay again."
206,,"If you are looking for a cheap stay you can book it, but don't expect much. It was not very clean but we survived it, it wasn't THAT bad. Don't expect much from the breakfast, euh... breakfast?"
207,,"My wife and I recently spent six nights at the Millennium Knickerbocker in Chicago. The city was unfamiliar to us so we relied on staff--concierge, bellmen, and bartenders--to make suggestions on restaurants, music venues, tours, etc. In every situation, staff were helpful, informed, courteous, extremely friendly and engaging. Our room was clean and comfortable. I do quite a bit of travelling and would rank our stay near the top of any hotel in my experience."
208,,"We got into the lobby and two guys were in the reception enclosure area. One of the guys was wearing a heavy metal shirt that read psycho-something. For a double room it was only $40 so we figured we are only staying the night so no big deal, right? So we got a room key and got buzzed into the hall way and decided to take the stairs to the 4th floor (the elevator didn't look too safe). As we go up the stairs the combination of smells weird decor and sounds led me to believe that there wasn't something quite right about this place. We finally got to our floor and decided we should at least try to look at the room. The room was 408 so we got to the door and there was evidence of the door being kicked in at some point. After a few minutes we were finally able to get the door to open. It only took a look into the tiny room to realize that i wasn't wanting any part in a horror movie that night. The room had a tiny bed in it and the linens probably hadn't been washed in the last few months. The room was very dirty and there was a small sink to the right that had ants crawling in it. The room was also about 80 degrees and had very stale air. There was a fan but no AC. I would have not been able to sleep there, especially with my mind contemplating at what point the door was going to be kicked in again, me awaiting the same fate of some other poor traveler. I would have rather taken my chances sleeping on the street this particular evening."
209,,"Spent a month working in Chicago, and the company booked this room for us. Very cozy, comfortable, well-secured, and friendly front desk. Decorated fairly nicely - the apartment had some personality to it, and didn't feel like a chain hotel. Televisions were old and starting to get blurry, and the one in the bedroom didn't work at all (we didn't care, though - the one in the living room worked). Exercise room was small. Within walking distance of several nice bars and restaurants, and Whole Foods."
210,,"Not fancy, no frills...just what we needed to be frugal on a room where we spent barely a wink. (Who spends time in your room in Chicago?) Everywhere we went we walked; everywhere was within 15 mins.Desk staff was helpful when asking questions. Perfect for people on a budget, or wanting to spend money elsewhere in the city! Not to mention...FREE parking!"
211,,"We spent 4 nights at the Omni to celebrate my mother's birthday. We were traveling with our 2 year old &amp; chose the Omni for it's family friendly reputation. We were very pleased. We got a great rate through the hotel's own website--less than $200/night for a primo Gold Coast location. Here's a point by point: Cleanliness--no problem here. The rooms were neat, clean &amp; stocked with abundant linens &amp; delightful bath salts (nice if you're a bath salt type).Location: Fantastic! About 1 mile to Millenium Park. We had beautiful weather &amp; walked a lot.Rooms: The rooms are all suites, which is great if you have a toddler in a crib. Would have given a 5th star, but from our corner room on the 25th floor, we could hear the service elevator all night. We didn't notify the staff, so I really have no right to complain, but next time I'll request a room away from the elevators.Service: The Omni's real strength is the staff. Everyone we interacted with was warm, friendly, professional &amp; dedicated. The concierge, Amiri, proved to be an invaluable resource for us Chicago newbies. The restaurant staff were professional and very knowledgeable about their products. Everyone doted on our two year old son &amp; the Omni Kids gift pack (plastic toys) kept him well entertained. A woman in the lobby greeted my husband with a bottle of water when he returned from a morning run.I gave 5 stars because the staff was excellent, but not perfect. Cake and champagne the concierge graciously arranged for my mother was sent to our room instead (oops!). The front desk had me sign a form for a &quot;fit kit&quot; that was apparently delivered to my room &amp; for which I would be charged $160 if I didn't return it. It turned out that it was never delivered. This situation was immediately and easily resolved with 1 phone call.Value: We felt we got a great deal. My mother &amp; her husband were very happy &amp; comfortable in their room. We loved having the restaurant, with it's variety of excellent, well-prepared fare right downstairs. We joined the &quot;select guest&quot; program &amp; had complimentary &quot;good&quot; coffee delivered to our rooms in the morning (The Wolfgang Puck coffee pods provided in the room are swill). The &quot;select guest&quot; is well worth joining (free!) if you want to use Wi-Fi ($9.95/day if you aren't a member, free if you are) or have good beverages to wake up to.The Omni was a great &quot;home base&quot; for our museum trips. We aren't really shoppers, but if we were, the Omni would be located in paradise. Happily recommend it for family getaways."
212,,"Our company had 6 rooms for 5 nights. They had no internet access at all. When the guys approached the front desk they were told they would restart the server. This happened for 2 days and did not correct the problem. I called the front desk and spoke to the manager Tatiana, she was extremely rude and even laughed when I told her that NONE of the guys could access the internet. FINALLY the GM Larry Knottingham called me and was very polite and helpful however assured me the problem had been corrected and the guys still cannot access the internet. 2 of our guys had to have their cards reactived as they would not work. WILL NOT BE STAYING THERE FOR OUR NEXT MEETING."
213,,A repeat stay can often be disappointing in a hotel - not with the Park Hyatt. Every single detail is thought out to please the guest. It is absolutely the BEST example of running an excellent hotel - worth every penny spent.
214,,The staff was very friendly and the location is great. The room itself was terrible. The first room we were put in smelled like something had died in it. The A/C did not work. The &quot;fridge&quot; did not work either. We were moved to another room down the hall. It did not smell. The A/C did not work in this room either. The &quot;fridge&quot; kept our food cold when the housekeeper didn't shut it off.The hotels brochure state that they have Pillow tip mattresses. They did not in the 2 rooms we were in. It was the HARDEST bed that I have ever tried to sleep on. The guest rooms were in dire need of a good remodel. The bath room had been updated.
215,,Perfect location with perfect value! Walking distance to Navy Pier. Just one block away from Michigan ave.
216,,"We loved the hotel and the location. We stayed here for a Sat. and Sun., and would have spent another night if the hotel hadn't been full. Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and roomier than we expected for a center city hotel. The rooms were also very quiet, althouhg you could here the El if you were on the backside of the hotel. The location was also excellent and we walked to restaurants, the Sears (Willis) Tower, and the Chicago River boat tour that left from Michigan and Wacker Dr. Of course, we had very good weather (chilly, but no rain) or we woudn't have been able to do this - probably would have taken taxis, since driving and parking are a hassle if you're not used to it. We did not move our car for 2 days. We did not eat here so I can't rate that, though they do have a Starbucks on premise which we used for morning coffee after finishing the small pot of coffee in our room. There were just too many other places to try for food. I have two recommendations that might help others: On weekends, use one of the parking lots within a block of the hotel, since there is plenty of parking available, and they charge a lot less than the $50 per night we paid to park at the Renaissance. Also, if you don't have to be on the river, there are several other hotels by Marriott that are very close to this one, but are less expensive."
217,,"The architecture and food in Chicago are two thumbs up! The Renaissance Hotel - O'Hare has beautiful rooms but if you are a light sleeper you can hear planes taking off. The shuttle drivers are very helpful and friendly. Carlucci's Italian Restaurant nearby gets a 10 for food, service and atmosphere. Shoeless Joe Jackson's is a huge sports bar - huge portions, bar atmosphere.The downside is the commute to downtown. The trains are usually packed so we ended up standing for the 40 minute ride downtown. One of my friends had her wallet stolen on the Red Line. Very crowded and she forgot to take off her backpack purse.The wait to see the Sears Tower is 1 1/2 hours to get tickets and 1 1/2 hours to get to the sky deck so plan ahead. Water taxis are a great way to get full views of the downtown buildings. The Pier has something for everyone but the restrooms are far apart. The Frank Lloyd Wright tours are NOT available on the weekend.Howl at the Moon has great entertainment! Unfortunately, the server (who knew we were from out of town) or bartender added 6 beers to our bill and we didn't catch it until the next day. We contacted them but they basically said too bad. CHECK YOUR FOOD/BAR TABS BEFORE YOU PAY!!!Chicago was interesting but the thefts will keep me from returning."
218,,"Got a real good deal on internet site, one of the nicest hotels I've been at for it's price and location. It within walking distance of a lot of attractions, and the room featured a kitchen and really nice TV."
219,,"I booked a room for this hotel and got a great online rate. Since the rate was so low I did not expect much from this hotel and was worried because I turned down a popular (but expensive) 4 star hotel to stay here...I was completely wrong. First off this is a brand new hotel which means new sheets,furniture,kitchen,bathroom,lobby etc. The rooms were extremely clean, spacious, and impressive. I went during the middle of the week so not only did I receive a free hot breakfeast buffet in the morning, but a free dinner buffet at night,and to be honest the selection and food was excellent. The hotel also had free wifi in lobby and room, and also a free business center in case you forgot your laptop. They have an exercise room, pool and hot tub on the top floor overlooking the city (perfect after a long day). The one aspect of the hotel that stood out the most was the amazing service and friendliness of the employees. Each morning I was greeted, when I came back they welcomed me,when I needed help they knew exactly where everything was, when I needed extra towels and sheets it came to the door in less than 2 minutes!! This hotel makes most marriot hotels I stayed in seem like 2 star hotels.Each hotel I stay in I can find at lest one con (even if it is minor) but this hotel was 100% perfect! I will only stay at this hotel in Chicago, even if the rate is double of what I paid."
220,,"My hotel experience at the Residence Inn Midway was fantastic! The staff is the friendliest I have ever encountered - and I travel ALOT. The hotel is clean, spacious, and inviting. During my three week stay at this hotel, I felt right at home and was very happy. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the Chicago area!"
221,,I would highly recommend you this hotel. It's in really nice location to down town Chicago and rooms are really tidy and modern. I liked big bath room. Free wireless internet and laundry were really nice. They have nice cold drinking water in the hallway. Gim opens 5AM-10 PM. I will definetly come back here!!
222,,"I found this hotel after a last-minute Google Maps revelation. I was in the first few days of a road trip and my boyfriend and I would be passing through Chicago for a night. I'd booked a room at the South Loop Hotel in Chicago, but after checking out the location it didn't look like it would be nearly as fun as staying somewhere else. I found the Ruby Room and, although the prices weren't as good as I'd hoped, I went to their website to get more information. I was surprised to find that their direct rates were at least $50/night lower than those advertised on hotels.com, so I booked directly through them on their website and was so glad I did.We arrived and parked in the loading zone in front of the spa. Kelly at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful from the minute we walked in, and worked with us to schedule an energy healing session with Ryan later that afternoon. We got our keys and parking information and hauled our stuff up the long, steep stairs to our room - with the help of another employee, who carried some of our bags up the stairs and showed us around before leaving us to relax. We took a nap, got some coffee and pastries from the great bakery right across the street, and then went to the spa to meet with Ryan. We both had wonderful experiences with him and were left feeling relaxed and ready to take on the rest of the city for the night. Kelly again helped us with detailed directions to the places we wanted to go and gave us some great restaurant and bar suggestions. After dinner and a movie, we walked the blocks surrounding the hotel for an hour and enjoyed the neighborhood.In the morning, we reluctantly got out of our VERY comfortable bed and enjoyed the marble steam shower in our suite before heading across the street to Milk &amp; Honey for one of the best breakfasts we've ever had. We hated to leave the hotel and wished we were staying for another week! When we got home, we had a very nice postcard from the staff thanking us for staying with them - they even made a personal note based on what we'd told them about our plans for the rest of the trip. The Ruby Room was one of the highlights of our trip and I'd stay there again (OR MOVE IN!) in a second and advise anyone else to do the same."
223,,"My impression of the Seneca hotel was very good: staff was highly helpful, friendly and efficient, room was really big, with little kitchen, living room, 2 TVs, etc. the location, I don't think it can get any better! For shopping addicts, its in front of the Water Tower mall and seconds away from michigan avenue and all the other shops! Its also right next to the John Hancock observatory and close to many restaurants, such as the Cheesecake factory.One major black point in my trip was that i had the bad idea to make 2 long distance phone calls of 11 and 14 minutes each. Bill was unpleasant: $195 ! i mean, come on! it was just 2 calls, how can it possibly be so expensive! therefore, if you don't make any calls, you will be fine"
224,,"I don't know if this is a hotel or a safe house. The hotel is dirty, there is no front desk or actual check in. When we arrived we told them we had a reservation ,the &quot;front desk clerk&quot; gave us a look as if the word &quot;reservation&quot; sounded foreign to him, after a short explanation of what a reservation was, the hotel clerk decided to warn us and told us to check out the rooms before making a final decision. To say that these rooms are OUTDATED would be a compliment. The only positive thing that i could say about this hotel or ROACHTEL is that is located close to the Wrigley field. don't even consider paying $65 a night because that is just ridiculous. I think people should get paid to stay at this hotel."
225,,"This is the second time I have stay with my husband at the Sheraton. I just love it. First of all, it is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue but very close to walk to. It is just minutes walk from Navy Pier and is directly across the street from AMC East 21 Movie theater and Lizzy McNeils Pub. You really dont need to leave your block if you just want to relax for a weekend get away, stroll Navy Pier, catch a movie or grab a pint. The rooms are very clean and the beds are great!!! We had a corner room so it had 3 windows and was bigger than most. One thing I noticed is that you never wait for an elevator. One came instantly and the hotel was very busy with conventions and weddings. The valet parking does kinda stink. It does cost 50.00 but directly across the street is a parking garage. It may still cost but at least you dont have to wait so long to get your car. The staff however was very friendly and willing to help. It also helps when you tip. People who work in hotels dont make tons of money. So leave your housekeeper afew dollars on a pillow and tip the man hailing you a cab or bartender making you a drink. Definatley would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay downtown."
226,,"When we arrived, slowly moving receptionist said that there was nobody to help us with luggage (and I am visibly disabled!) The room was shabby, carpet torn, TV 20 years old, nothing to hold on in the shower. Worst of all, this hotel is located next to a large water resort. Everything throughout the hotel smells like sewer. Over the weekend the hotel fills with families with children, and these people don't behave. We had to call security twice to keep our neighbors quiet. The crowd brought to the lobby bags with fast food, ate it on every surface available and left trails of garbage everywhere they went. Just like that, on the floor. It reminded us Katrina shelters more than Sheraton. The restaurant is awful, food dangerous for your health. On top of this, this hotel is in the middle of nowhere, and you have to drive about 3 miles to the nearest place to eat."
227,,We were passing through Chicago on our way to New York and thought we would stay for 1 night. We were on our honeymoon and booked everything as we went along. We decided to stay at the Skylark because it was quite cheap and didn't look too bad on the internet. When we got to our room we were shocked to see that at some point the door had been kicked down and fixed very poorly. My husband put the mirror that was in our room under the door and hoped we would not get mugged or worse during the night. The wall were poorly painted and it was quite dirty. We were so glad to leave in the morning!
228,,"Stayed for 3 nights across the weekend of the 23 Oct as part of our honeymoon. Thos hotel was everyhting we had wanted and expected it to be.Friendly and efficient check in staff &amp; Bell Boys. Clean, modern room with views - we were onthe 27th floor. Attentive service (told them it was our honeymoon in advance and got some free strawberries dipped in chocolate.Good location close to Mag mile and 1 block from the subway if wanting to go down to the loop but Chicago is a pleasure to walk around.Didn't eat inthe hotel as have plenty of option close by.One grip would be we were kept awake by some very noisy machanical sounds on a number of night which went on constently - could have been the lifts but more likely the air con units onthe roof (not our in room air con as it was switched off). Quite annoying but otherwise a ver pleasent stay."
229,,"We paid 170/night - it was a pkg deal which included breakfast AND valet parking. We stayed in a King &quot;suite&quot;. My husband snores LOUDLY. So he slept in the king while the kids and I slept in the sitting area with noise makers all around us. The sitting area is a loveseat fold out with a fainting type couch alongside it forming an L shape-sort of like a mini-sectional. My 3 yr old and I slept on the foldout while my son who was just short enough (42 in.) to sleep on the fainting couch. The privacy wall between the bed area and sitting area functions as a enclosed writing desk on the side of the sitting area with a chair. It is enclosed by frosted/privacy glass. It's nice because the division goes from floor to ceiling. Usually in separate area suites (as opposed to separate bedroom suites) only have half walls. It worked out great! There is also a fridge, microwave and sink. Now, the rooms are smaller than one might think. The photos are always misleading on websites. For instance, when you pull the fold out bed from the love seat, there is very little space between the foot of the bed and the privacy wall/desk. When the bed is folded out, it pretty much takes up most of the sitting area. Same thing with the pool. It's a lot smaller than it looks. Great fitness center though. Really great breakfast. It was clean. Also, there is a free trolley 2 blocks from the hotel that goes on a route to Navy Pier. One WARNING for parents w/ toddlers- One think I really felt unsafe about is that they have bottom windows that can be opened and have NO screens! Fortunately, my kids never figured it out"
230,,"The hotel was nice enough. The common areas and room were clean and the beds were fine. The shuttle from the airport took a while to come; I saw shuttles for other hotels come by twice while waiting for the SpringHill's. The following morning, though, just as we were walking out the door the shuttle was leaving to bring other guests to the train station and the driver dropped us off at the nearby supermarket so we could by transit passes. The night we arrived we had dinner at the attached Outback Steakhouse, and the waiter there was helpful with advice on getting Chicago around by transit.The one issue I had with the hotel was nose. Our room was on the 6th floor at the far east end of the hotel, and the noise from the trains and occasional landing aircraft was noticeable. In addition, we could hear noises coming from the vents both in the bathroom and above the kitchen area that sounded like it was coming from other rooms."
231,,"We stayed for 2 nights toward the end of May at the this Super 8. There is really no lobby - about 4 feet of floor space and a glassed in front desk. A very small elevator - 2 people with luggage is all that it will hold. The complimentary breakfast area had 2 tables with 4 chairs each. The items in the breakfast included 3 kinds of cereal, toast, small muffins and danish, coffee and juice. Must people took their food back to their room.We had a room with 2 beds &amp; a table that had 2 chairs. The room was okay and seemed clean. The bathroom was also very small. The area seemed pretty safe and we were told to walk about 4 blocks to find a restaurant which we did - the restaurant was pretty good. There were several other places to eat within walking distance. We were in town for a Cubs game and found El 5 blocks away to be very convenient. The hotel does have free parking. Most of which is an enclosed lot (on 3 sides). Lake Michigan is a block away which is nice. The price seemed a little high for what was offered - about $300 including taxes for what was offered. I would probably not stay here again if I could get a room at the Days Inn in Lincoln Park which happened to be full when we were there."
232,,"This was by far the worst Super 8 hotel I have ever seen. It was my first stay at this hotel and appeared very run down as I entered the lobby at 4:30 PM with a reservation for two nights. I was the only guest at the check in desk but neither of the two employees behind the desk even acknowledged my presence for several minutes. One was taking a reservation (OK) the other was counting money and continued until he was done. I finally checked in for my wife and I to a Queen suite. Upon entering the room, we were dismayed to find a bed with one pillow missing and a towel laying on the bed, the ironing bed set up in a corner with another towel on it and a towel on the bathroom floor. I immediately complained to the desk clerk about an apparent uncleaned room. He offered to clean it??? then offered another room but by this time we just wanted out. After I conviced him we were leaving, he left me standing and waiting while he took 2 more reservations. He stated he would still need to charge me for a nights stay and was that OK, I said it was not OK, I just wanted to check out. When I asked for a copy of the charges to my credit card, he said I would need to come back in the morning, but finally did give me one after I requested a second time. Bottom line - I was charged for one nights stay for a room that we did not use and not only looked bad but smelled bad as well. This was the worst experience I've ever had at any hotel of any kind."
233,,We have stayed at the Swissotel many times. The accomodations and support services are phenomenal. All staff members are very courteous and go the extra mile in meeting your needs during your stay. I would encourage everyone to make the Swissotel your lodging destination next time you go to Chicago. You won't regret it and will return for future trips to the windy city.
234,,"Stayed at The Wit for 4 nights at the end of October with a friend. We had a room with 2 queen beds and a massive tv! Room was spacious and really clean, maids did a good job each day and not forgetting the beds which are soooo comfortable!Hotel is a great location, can walk everywhere including to Navy Pier, Art Institute, Willis Tower and The John Hancock Centre (or as we were told in the lift as we came down, we could now call it 'The John' which slightly amused us 2 English people!). The Hotel is right by the El but this didn't disturb us and we used it to get to the Aquarium.Staff at the Hotel are very friendly and helpful, recommended places to eat, helped with our onward travel, no question was too small for them. Special mention to the door staff who welcomed you back each day as if you had always been there. And the cookies are good too!I can't fault anything about this hotel and we had an amazing stay."
235,,"I stayed at the Blackstone A Renaissance Hotel for two nights for a short getaway. The plan was to do a little sightseeing, shop, and visit Harpo Studios as an audience member =). The hotel is lovely. The building is just breathtaking (though the interior is a bit too modern and does clash). The rooms were a very nice size with a huge marbled bathroom. The bed was comfortable, there is a large flat panel TV, wireless (which is not free and just overpriced), and a Starbucks located right in the hotel (though that staff just did not know what they’re doing so it really was not that much of a bonus) . It really is just a beautiful hotel. Service…well, to be very honest the check in staff was a bit uppity. I found the female employees to be rather rude upon check in, so I really didn’t feel like asking them anything. The doormen were incredibly, wonderfully helpful and kind as was the cleaning staff. I’m sure service is fine at the Blackstone, but we were really put off by the tone when we arrived. However, this does not make or break a person’s stay. I think I can put up w/ just about anything as long as I’m in a clean room w/ a good location. And location is something you need to seriously consider before booking your stay at the Blackstone. I think to get to Harpo Studios the location is fine. It’s a $12 (tip included) cab ride to the show. If you’re visiting the Chicago Art Museum or Millennium or Grant Park it’s a ten minute walk. To Chicago O’Hare airport it’s a good 30 minutes by taxi at $40 (tip included), or 1 hour 20 minutes by metro (only recommend using during the day, have to change lines after first stop) for $2.00. However, if you want to be in the middle of things (and I think we all do!) you should not stay at this hotel. I think that if travelers should stay at the hotels located on the Magnificent Mile, where all the restaurants and shops are. Hotels over there are also a ten minute walk from the parks and museums. The Blackstone, while lovely and comfortable, is just not as conveniently located as other hotels with the same rate or lower. At night, being two women alone in the city, we felt a little more weary in this location. Also, normally on my trips I prefer taking a city’s metro/subway – it’s just a great way to save money! On this trip we didn’t do that despite the close location of the metro (5 minute walk). Even walking from the metro to our hotel in the day we felt a little unsafe, so we sure weren’t going to take it at night! But, to reiterate, this is a lovely hotel just wasn’t a convenient enough location and not enough shops or restaurants around."
236,,"Great overnight stay at The Drake on 11/7. I reserved the room at a great price via Priceline. I sent the manager an email requested a renovated room and he made it happen! I was pleased with the follow through, especially since we were paying a lower rate. Yes, the rooms are a bit dated but that is by design. If you are looking for sleek and modern, stay at W. Parking was a bit steep at $49 but that includes in &amp; out, which we utilized to pack up at the end of the stay utnil we were done shopping. Overall, great stay and I would recommend to anyone looking for a night away."
237,,"We loved this building. It was conveniently located in the Loop and near the El. The first floor had retail establishments such as dry cleaners and a convenience store. We also had high speed internet in our room along with the full size kitchen. The furniture provided was beautiful and very upscale. We originally booked our stay because our daughter is moving to Chicago and wanted to check it out. Since we enjoyed the building and the management so much, she has decided to live there long term. Bring a blowdryer with you, though, since one is not provided in the apartment."
238,,"If you can afford to stay at the Pennisular in Chicago, please do you won't be disappointed.Amer Express had a deal where you had a discounted room rate , free upgrade, free breakfast, one afternoon tea. I went with the Royal Tea which included champagne and caviar. We also had Sunday Bruch which was very nice. The Hotel is 5 star in everyway. The house keeping is &quot;ghostly&quot; where you don't see them but always see their handiwork. No carts in the hallway. The Spa was a pleasent experience where we had a couples massage. The service is so good by the time you hang up the phone for service someone is knocking at your door with your request. The rooms along with the view are wonderful however stay on upper floors due to the noise and cars on Michigan Ave.The service is so good while checking out our valet took our bags and even picked up a Chicago style pizza we had earlier ordered and met us at our car as we left for home dodging Oprah's 2009 season opening show on Michigan Ave."
239,,We loved this hotel. It was so clean and nice. Comfortable beds! The staff was very friendly and helpful and we felt welcomed at all times. It was so easy to get dressed with three girls in the room. The vanity was a huge plus!!! From the shoe shiner to the mini bar everything was top of the line!
240,,"One up side of the down economy is that savvy travelers can enjoy some real bargains. My wife and I recently took advantage of a significant deal offered by The Ritz-Carlton Chicago. The hotel was offering a credit (read: discount!) of $100 per night for guests who stayed a minimum of two nights. Because we planned to drive from Indianapolis after work on Friday anyway, it was perfect: the luxury of the Ritz-Carlton for a room rate of about $25 a night more than we would have spent on a much more modest hotel at the other end of the Magnificent Mile.The service was impeccable. From the bellman who greeted us and took our luggage to our room to the desk clerks, the concierge, and room service attendants, everything was top-flight. The hotel is located in Water Tower Place, kitty-corner from the famous Chicago water tower, across from the John Hancock Building, and adjacent to a shopping mall with the store my wife refers to as her “mother ship”: Macy’s. (Try the Frango mints; they’re a true Chicago treat!)Our room, 2222, was a Deluxe room and included a king bed, easy chair, desk, big-screen TV, huge closet, and a minibar. The room faced south with what real estate agents would describe as a “peek view” of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier, but had shades and curtains that kept the morning sun at bay until we were ready to greet it.The bath was quite large with double sinks; a separate tub and toilet area; generous, fluffy towels; a hair dryer; lighted makeup mirror; robes and slippers; and high-end L’Occitane en Provence amenities. Lounging about in bathrobes, reading the paper, and sipping coffee is a great way to start the day so, on Saturday morning, we decided to treat ourselves to room service. The French Country breakfast consisted of assorted, cured meats and cheeses, artisan bread, a croissant, citrus mostarda, café au lait, and brewed coffee. It was delivered within 1/2 hour of our call and was delicious!Thus fortified, we got ready to head out onto the Magnificent Mile and enjoy some surprisingly glorious November weather. After a day spent doing a little shopping and a lot of wandering through art galleries along the Mag Mile and in the city’s River North neighborhood, we were ready for a nice dinner. Chicago is also home to a number of wonderful dining spots, many are within easy walking distance of the Ritz-Carlton. While my wife and I thoroughly enjoy fine food and aren’t hesitant about paying for it, some of the trendier spots in the area seemed to smack of a “popularity premium,” so we asked one of the concierge staff for other recommendations. The concierge, a member of Les Clef d’Or, recommended a new Mexican restaurant that opened on Kinzie Street in September, just a short cab ride from the hotel. There’s a lot to do in Chicago, from shopping and sightseeing when the weather is good to a broad range of museums, theatres, and other indoor attractions when the weather is bad. I highly recommend considering The Ritz-Carlton as your base of operations, no matter what the weather!"
241,,"Even though this hotel is located on a street where the train runs right out front....it was so unbelievably quiet! When you think about why you go to a hotel in the first place, it's usually to get a good nights sleep! You will here. If you are looking for a room with a view...don't stay here! If you are looking for a good nights sleep...this is it. We did have breakfast in the dining on the ground floor and it was a nice breakfast. Staff was very friendly and helpful, parking and valet was a breeze! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
242,,"Perfect location - close to everything (for a first-timer to Chicago) but just the right distance away (couple of blocks) from the &quot;busy streets&quot;.Doormen were friendly, staff were good, rooms were decent, and a hidden surprise - a business centre with free internet access for guests!We also signed up for the Sutton Place loyalty club, which gave us free wi-fi, and after only one 5 night stay (with some bonusing), we already have enough points to redeem for a breakfast buffet for 2! Really great value as we took advantage of &quot;room sale&quot; pricing offered by Sutton's website."
243,,"We stayed at the Talbott for two nights in November 2009. It was a great home base for exploring downtown Chicago, just a block from the shops on Michigan Avenue and a short cab ride to the Art Institute and Navy Pier.Our room was on the smallish side but comfortable and clean. My only complaint was the bed linens, which consisted of a duvet and decorative throw (no top sheet). I prefer a bit more weight/substance, and even at 5'4&quot; I had to choose whether to cover my shoulders or my feet.One tip: Skip the continental breakfast. It's a European-style spread and features only yogurt, bread, cereal, sliced meats and sliced cheeses."
244,,"We took a quick weekend trip to Chicago, and we wanted a hotel that was cheap, clean, and centrally located. The Tremont is an older hotel located right off the Magnificent Mile, about 2 blocks from the Hancock Tower. The rooms were basic, but the bed and the bathrooms were clean, which was the most important aspect. There was a door dividing our room from the room next door, so we were able to hear the neighbors quite a bit. The hotel is on a quiet side street, so there was not much traffic noise.The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from the lakefront, and about a 10 minute walk from the subway. There was a restaurant attached to the hotel, Ditka's, which was a bit pricey. However, there were other restaurants within walking distance (and a Starbucks directly across the street)."
245,,"I've stayed here at least 20 times and the staff are unfailingly nice. It's about average for what you'd expect in a Westin. They seem much more interested in how often you've stayed with them at this location than what your overall Starwood relationship is, which is disappointing. And the Platinum lounge is kind of lame - you feel like they are trying to shake you down for anything other than tap water, and it closes early. They also try to charge you for internet access on the lobby computers, just to print a boarding pass. But location is good and treatment is good."
246,,"Great location in downtown Chicago however sadly that is where the positives end. It is your typically business hotel... turn those rooms. The front desk throughout my stay was understaffed, there was always a line of guests, service lackluster. My room was tiny, the bathroom even smaller, the bathroom was not cleaned very well, hair in the bathtub, the counter space not dusted, the amenities were cheap, the iron barely heated. The thinnest walls I have ever have experienced, I heard the elevator all night, doors closing, people talking... I was disappointed as I have stayed at various other Westin properties and generally have had a good experience. I would not recommend staying here."
247,,"this hotel is smack bang in the middle of everything great location and great hotel ,hotel rooms are lovely what more could you need.."
248,,"Our family has been to The Willows Hotel on 3 separate occasions and we will return in 2 weeks to stay there again. It is located less than one block from our daughter's apt. and within walking distance of great restaurants and shops. It is easily accessible from the train and buses. One stay was by myself in Winter and I had a great room that overlooked the street. The beds are wonderful. And even though it is an older hotel, we have never heard people coming or going. The rooms we've had with 2 beds faced the alley, but were spacious. The bathrooms are on the small side, but everything is sparkling clean and the front desk people are great. I am so glad we found this place since our daughter has 4 years to go.Note: I marked that they do not have a swimming pool, but on our last visit, they had passes to the large Bally gym nearby, don't know if that's still going on."
249,,"Very close to the Loop. Furniture is a bit dated, but comfortable. Great free wireless internet in rooms. Very nice Thai restaurant in the house, or a cheapy fast food place with friendly staff."
250,,"Everything about Trump Chicago is stellar. From the the Bell Desk, to the Conceirge, to room service, to housekeeping. They make an effort to address patrons by name and are eager to please and make one's stay comfortable. The spa is fabulous as well. A special commendation to the Conceirge desk for making all my reservations without a hitch. Highly, highly recommend this hotel for your next visit to the Windy City."
251,,"I have stayed at the Union League three or four times now over the last two years and enjoy it more and more each time.This 23-story private clubhouse has 180 suites and guestrooms, three restaurants, two bars, various ballrooms, private meeting rooms, amazing food, and a world-class art collection. The health club is free to use and fills five floors of the building. It includes a pool, steam, sauna, free weights, cardio workout, and just about whatever else you can think of.The staff is very professional and very attentive.The business center is first-rate. It includes private offices and open carrels. The library is exactly what you'd expect one to be like in a private club.The location is in the heart of downtown, so it's convenient to the theater district, Millennium Park, shopping, the lakefront, and plenty of restaurants.This isn't a &quot;trendy&quot; place by any stretch of the imagination, and I wouldn't come here with a family of teenagers, but it's great for adults and small children. NOTE: The Union League does have a business casual dress code (no jeans, gym shoes, or t-shirts, unless you're going directly from your room to outside the clubhouse or vice versa)."
252,,"Driving to the hotel from O'Hare airport, we thought it seemed in the middle of nowhere. However, we discovered that it is near 2 large malls and many restaurants. Also many major highways are nearby making it very easy to get to other places in the suburbs. Check-in was easy and friendly. Our room was on the top floor so we had no problem with noise from the atrium. There was good Starbucks coffee in the room. The bathroom was small, the amenities sparse (a little leaf soap never replenished which slipped thru the soap holder in the shower, no shower caps etc). The towels were small; less expensive chains have much better towels and give you more of them. Both at this Westin and the subsequent one we stayed in on Michigan Avenue skimped on towels. We always had to find the maid and ask for more. The pillows were very soft. There was a nice wide desk. The room was well designed with a place to put 2 suitcases- not always the case- in one hotel suite, we had to put one suitcaes on the table. The elevators were very slow; there were no papers on the weekends. At least we got on on our door during the week. We didn't downtown in spite of being platimim clients- even after asking. Some people have complained about there only being one restaurant but there is a breakfast bar with good bagels at a good price and there are 2 other fast food places down the corridor which had inexpensive, quick food. The Sunday buffet at Ditka's was very reasonable. All in all it was a good place to stay. One caveat- there were a number of youth sports teams staying there so you might want to avoid their floors."
253,,"This was a great little hotel for access to Soldier Field and the museums. It is a relatively short walk to them and to Grant Park. The service was good and the rooms large. It is an old mansion that could use a little updating. We had a king suite in the front of the house. For the size of the room, the location, and the city of Chicago the charges were appropriate. I was concerned about walking to Soldier Field and back at night but those worries were dispelled when limos and taxi were dropping off concert goers in front of our hotel and there was a strong police presence. Obviously i felt safe that night. There was a solid breakfast in the morning. All in all it was a nice and comfortable place in a great location for the concert and at a decent price."
254,,Wonderful hotel in a great part of Chicago - very quiet street and a short walk from some great bars and restaurants and it is only a 5/10 minute drive to downdown Chicago. The restuarants are also much better value in this neighbourhood than downtown. The staff were wonderul and always willing to help. The rooms of very high standard and extremely comfortable. They do a very simple buffet breakfast - nothing special but was included in the price. You can take your breakfast up to your room - which is quite helpful as the space and seating in reception is not really geared up for eating breakfast. They also have tea and coffee on tap 24/7. This is a great hotel and really is home from home. I will certainly stay here again.
255,,"Nice hotel, great location, minutes away from the Magnificent Mile. Our rooms were nice and big (deluxe room) and the only thing I could really complain about was the noise of the ambulances at night, but that is just due to the proximity of the hotel to the hospital. Our room was on the 17th floor so the noise wasn't terrible, but I could definitely hear them at night, however, they did not keep me up, I was just awake when they passed by, others in my party didn't know what I was talking about the next morning when I asked about it, they slept through the night with no problems. It was also a little annoying that you had to enter the hotel and then take one set of elevators to get to the main floor where the other set of elevators were located to take you to your rooms. But overall a very enjoyable stay, friendly staff, nothing of note to complain about. I would definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Chicago."
256,,"This was the worst hotel I've stayed in for a very long time. I imagine this is what it would feel like if ikea decorated a hotel room--a room in a tiny space lab! The rooms were so small and the amenities were next to none--they didn't even provide local magazines, just more advertising brochures for the W. It was very uncomfortable--you could barely even use the toilet. The bed was comfortable but that was pretty much the full size of the room. The view was non-existent and the walls were so thin you could hear very clearly into other rooms. The only thing worse than the room was the service. We asked for a nearby breakfast place and the concierge just pointed us to starbucks. When we couldn't find ice and called down for help, they were so snobby saying there's ice on every floor--turns out it was in a locked, unmarked room! When we tried out the bar downstairs, the bartender was very unfriendly and the overall space was small and dark. The room service more than doubled the price of the items which were already inflated - $40 for a chicken sandwich! The area at night is pretty dead. I highly recommend you pass on this one - definitely NOT one of starwood's strongest showings ..."
257,,I had a great trip with family and teenrestaurant was goodyes it is a &quot;bar scene&quot; lower level but no one was out of controlrestaurant was a little slow sometimes but overall good and food was goodI get concerned with the bad reviews as when I read that customer service doesnt care I equate that with dirty bathroomsI would go backyes elevators are slow but come on its not that bad (imo)
258,,"Good hotel offering value for money. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. Hotel is in a good location. Al Ghubaiba bus station, Carrefour supermarket &amp; Dubai creek are at walkable distances. The neighbourhood has some good Indian restaurants."
259,,"We stayed in a family apartment for 6 nights, the accommodation was roomy and basically equipped. We expected noise from the airport but could hardly hear the traffic outside. The apartment was cool enough not to have the air-con on all the time, a plus factor not to have the noise all the time! The food outlets were okay - the Pastry Shop our favourite. Getting taxis too and from the Centre just depended on the time of day and the route. One day it took 2hrs from Ski Dubai, but the next day it only took 1/2hr. Anyway we got a tour of the city and outskirts. I would recommend a stay if you want value for money."
260,,"I visited the al bustan hotel in december of the last year due to a long stopover in Dubai. I got a special offer on the hotel. Still expensive for my standards but compared to the other hotels very affordable.I was transfered to the hotel from the airport in a limousine driven by the most friendly man you could imagine.When I had arrived which was late around 1 am i checked in and everyone was nice although it being so late. I was given my room key and so I walked to the room and additionally wandering around the hotel. My room was amazing simple but large and equiped with everything you need. And everything was incredibly clean. At 3 am i was so thirsty and not wanting to pay huge amounts for things from the mini bar i went to the place where breakfast was served. I asked them if I could have something to drink and although they were preparing something the took the time and got me something. Which I thought was great. I know my expectations aren't that high. Give me a drink and a bed and i am happy.At breakfast time i went to the place where it was served and it was beautiful had fresh fruit, continental, asian and arabic? breakfast?.After that i left and was driven back to the airport. I couldn't have asked for more.A little tip when you arrive at the airport and don't have a hotel it is worth to haggle because the usually cut the price a bit. You have to because most hotels aren't affordable for people like me. After that i was off to Hong Kong!"
261,,"Checking all the comments on the website, this hotel seemed quite OK, so I booked on their HP. Quick response to the reservation. After several confirmations on air port pick-up including last-minute mail exchange, in the end no welcome at the air port as expected at 5 AM... Called the hotel, the person who answered just kept telling &quot;Pls call after 2 hours&quot;. So took the public bus to the al-Sabha bus station and took a long walk from there. A staff finally came at 8am. No apology from the hotel at check-in, though I showed the confirmation mail. Beware, the hotel appeals as it is free of charge, but they do charge 50Drh at check-out, the same price as you take a cab from the air port. No early check-in allowed, but I was finally allowed to use the shower at 10am.  The room was the best thing about this hotel! Bathroom was clean enough. The towel was too old and dusty...better bring your own. Breakfast was good; omlette or cooked beans with bread, tea, coffee or fresh juice on your request. Adequate qty. The worst thing was that they cheated the price again at check-out. I just took a memo of the total amount of my stay and paid. But they claimed it is without tax of 20%, so I shld pay more. Didnt remember where I quote total amount at this moment(stupid!), so after some complaints, reached an agreement to add 10% instead of 20%, on 420=462Drh/night. Back home, checked the website, and it was written as 350+20%=420!! So they earned 170Drh(USD 55) from my payment. Do check the price with tax and services in advance. Staffs are not professional but friendly. That's tricky. Rooms are OK, but the service and what you pay don't match. Pity, I won't go again...or with all the documentation, maybe cld survive and win!"
262,,"We stayed here just one night as a stop-over between Paris and Melbourne. It is a 5min taxi ride to airport. Room very clean with lovely decor. Bathroom absolutely spotless and spacious with big fluffy towels, great hot water pressure, good amenities. Couldnt complain for a quick stopover. Breakfast was included in our rate. Although there was a good selection of cereals, bakery items and fruit, all of the &quot;hot&quot; food was stone cold as the burners underneath the trays had long gone out. It was also the first buffet breakfast Ive been to that has hard boiled eggs (in their shells) with no other egg variations and there were no sausages or bacon or tomatoes but instead crumbed chicken fillets and chicken nuggets which didnt look very appetising at that hour of the monring. Not that it mattered as they were cold anyway! So, a good, clean, well-located hotel but hopefully the breakfst situation will improve!!"
263,,"This was a lovely surprise for the money, as I'd found some varying reviews before booking. We paid $135 for a very last-minute booking out of a travel agent in Baku (who is contracted by my partner's employer); it's hard to know what to believe, but the prices posted at the front desk of the hotel were more than twice this amount, so definitely do book before you go. We had found similar prices at various sites online. This is not luxury by any means, but it is more than sufficient, and if (like us) you are development warriors working in the third world, it is a lovely break from paying $100+ for a hotel room with cockroaches, cold water, etc. Though it did smell a bit of cigarette smoke, it was clean and the linens were spotless. The bathroom was fully functioning, good-to-great water pressure (depending on your standards - again, mine have been lowered significantly living in Africa!), and lovely complementary soaps. The only drawback to the bathroom was that the tub was small and strangely shallow (though elevated off the ground about a foot) - we think it had something to do with being adjacent to the elevator on the other side of the wall. Anyway, as long as you're not looking for a good long soak in the tub, this is hardly an issue. Our room, like every room, I'm told, had a private balcony and we actually had a great view of the creek - a lovely place to sit for a nightcap. The minibar was well stocked and reasonably priced (hard to imagine but true!), and had a selection of sodas, Heineken, water and candies. A fantastic electronic safe was included, allowing us to leave our cash and other valuables without any concern. The TV selection was OK, mostly international news, including the standard CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, etc...also a Russian News channel for any Russophiles. Our room was very spacious, though I will qualify that by noting that we got a suite (even though we paid for a standard double) so I'm not sure what the normal rooms look like...not that it matters, b/c what is it that you're really doing in your hotel room that requires space?!?I can't vouch for the breakfast or the restaurants, because we never patronized them. The bar looked seedy (what you'd expect for a businessman's hotel), but the Italian Restaurant looked pleasant - we didn't purposely avoid it, just never got around to eating there in our 4 days. The staff was friendly and helpful, and we booked an evening desert safari through them without a problem. The location, for us, was excellent - a 2 minute walk to the creek and you're on a dhow (water taxi) to zip across the river to Bur Dubai (the 'Old City' - a large portion of which is a brand-new recreation of the old city!). You do have to take a taxi to get to the beach or head out to the other far-flung attractions - but this is pretty standard b/c the whole place is so spread out. I'd recommend staying in this area, b/c it's the only part of the city that IS walkable (near the Gold Souk and Spice Souk), and then making trips out to as necessary - taxis are reasonable and there's almost nothing that would cost more than $15, with most trips closer to $5-$8. It is also possible to walk to the City Centre, if you're a walker (we are!) - it took about 45 mins one night, but is a lovely stroll and there are always ample sidewalks EVERYWHERE in Dubai!All in all, this is more than a good value for the money. It is not the kind of place that you want to lounge around and unwind at, per se, but it's a clean, safe, functional place to sleep and more than comfortable enough to spend an hour or two in the evening or afternoon unwinding. If you're an expat there for a weekend to retouch with civilization, such as it is, this is a great choice for your money. If you're coming FROM civilization to visit Dubai, you might be less impressed with this place, but it all depends on how much money you want to spend. Certainly don't hesitate to go if you're looking for a good value on a tight budget!"
264,,We were on the road from Oman to Dubai when we were told we were being moved to this hotel. A quick look at trip advisor via the blackberry convinced us to give it a try although we could have gone to our original hotel.The hotel is near Dubai Creek just off Al Maktoom Road and quite near the airport. Like most things in Dubai you'll need a taxi to get from A to B. The hotel got us a private car service which we used during our stay. A little more expensive but worth it.The rooms are large and comfortable. We had two rooms for the family (girls 3 and 5) but really only needed one. The hotel has 3 restaurants with one being a good Japanese one which requires a reservation. Breakfast was included in the room rate and this was of an acceptable if unspectacular standard.The staff were very friendly and treated us well. They were particularly good to our children which made the stay more enjoyable. Overall this was a great hotel to stay in and a welcome change from the chain hotel experience. It's nothing special in terms of quality and would be around a 2-3 star effort but would certainly stay there again.
265,,"I went on my honeymoon to Al Maha about two years ago now. It was breathtaking. The rooms were exceptional, the food was excellent, but the staff was definitely the highlight. Our guide was amazing, he knew the terrain like the back of his hand. We loved all the activities that are included, the sunset camel ride, the sand dune rides, archery, etc. Best of all would be when you come back to your room and could enjoy the pool in privacy. Since the hotel knew it was our honeymoon they left us a bottle of champagne to celebrate. I loved this hotel and have recommended it to several people. I would go back in a heartbeat. It is definitely one of the best places I have ever stayed."
266,,"We had a week at this hotel. The facilities are good, although hotel guests only get to use two of the three pools. The best and largest pool is reserved for residents, even though there was hardly ever anyone using it while we were there. The service at the front desk was poor, staff not particularly helpful with information and we felt they couldnt be bothered. Cleaning and maid service was great. The private beach is quite a distance from the hotel and you have to pay 165 dh per person to get there using hotel transport so cheaper to call a taxi, tennis is an also extra cost and we didnt see anyone using the courts. Rooms were clean and spacious but wouldnt stay here again, lack of personal service and unfriendly front desk staff."
267,,"Already 5 years we stay once or even twice a year at the Al Qasr hotel. The Al Qasr is part of the Madinat Jumeirah complex which is set up in Arabian Style with the two hotels MinaSalam and Al Qasr and the Souk shopping centre with very nice restaurants along the waterside. The third hotel is the Dar al Masyaf which are the villas set around the gardens and along the beach. The Madinat Jumeirah is located next to the Burj Al Arab.The Al Qasr Hotel is a five star de luxe hotel which derserves the 5 star easily. Everything is organized perfectly and if you choose the premium leisure club you get a separate lounge with playstation and kids playroom while you can enjoy the afternoon snacks and free drinks. Nothing is left to chance at Al Qasr , you can enjoy a very individual service , the staff is always ready to take care of you. Because the Madinat complex is so large you can either take the free abra boats to take you to the beach , pool or restaurant or you can by the buggy,s that are always standing by .The large collection of restaurants in the hotel and souk are a large variety from fish restaurants , thai, beachfront and steakhouses. We prefer the Meat and co at the souk , Pisces fishrestaurant, Zhenghe and Pai Thai. Both the pool and beach have a lot of beachbeds which are very comfortable . The pool is large and secured by lifeguards.There is a special kidsclub with a separate covered playground and slides.At the poolside you are pampered with cold towels and sprays. The talise spa is very spacious and nicely set up in the gardens. The treatments are various but you can also get a 20 minute massage at the beach.The Al Qasr hotel is an amazing hotel which keeps the standard year after year,We enjoy our time there every single holiday. The prices are pretty up there but it is good value for money.We love it !!"
268,,"I stayed here twice in 2005; room was booked by a company I was doing business with in DXB.First of all, the hotel is in a great location in the middle of Bur Dubai. Lots of shopping nearby, many restaurants, relatively close to the Creek, easy to get taxis. Within walking distance to a lot. Not sure of how easy it is to get to now (due to construction, etc). But not bad in 05.The hotel is one of the older places in Dubai, and looks it. Kind of like a 1970s Holiday Inn that has not been updated. Reception was efficient, if a bit indifferent. The porter was good. I had a one BR once and a one BR suite once. Both were clean, if a bit worn. About what you'd expect from an older 3*. No problems with housekeeping; clean sheets and linens. The one BR had a bed, OK mattress, dresser, desk and nightstand. The suite had a BR (just about the same as the one BR) and a good sized living room with sofas, chairs, table, etc. Nice size for the price, actually. Furnishings were OK, on a par with other 2/3 * places. Not up to the standards of upper level places, but a lot cheaper too.The hotel has an interesting mix of customers; lots of businessmen and a few tourists. Lots of business (cargo transfer, meetings, etc) going on in the lobby during the day.The hotel restaurant was OK; nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The pub - which claims to be one of the first in Dubai - was pretty good. There were a couple of &quot;working girls&quot; in the pub, but they were low-key and did not bother patrons who did not want their services. A note: the hotel has a 'sister' property - the Astoria - a couple of blocks away. While the place has a couple of OK restaurants, it is frequented by a fair number of prostitutes, seemingly at all hours. May not the place to take your wife/girl/family.I did not use the pool or other facilities, so I can't comment on how good/not good they are.Overall, an average place for the price, especially if you're in Dubai for business or are on a budget. Nice location, OK rooms, fair service."
275,,"This hotel is u're basic seedy prostitute pick up point. Although on their site they've advertised Sur Sangam as live indian entertainment club, its nothing but vulgar dance shows and money hungry managers coaxing you into throwing your money away. The Three stars should actually stand for Third class."
276,,"The staff were very friendly and obliging, spacious room, quite clean. Generally worth the money. In room email access, loads of tve channels"
277,,"I didn't expect much of this appartment hotel given its price and location.I was surprised on the upside. Very comfortable with a big bedroom and living room plus ample sized kitchen and bathroom. Kitchen is fully equipped. As I had a seventh floor room I also had a good view across the rooftops of Deira.The hotel is just off Al Nasr Square in Deira, Dubai and this tends to be where the &quot;riff-raff&quot; collects. Nevertheless I'd recommend this to those looking for quality and clean rooms but are on a budget."
278,,"Four of us stayed for a week in March 2007 at the Beit Al Bahar Villas, what an experience simply incredible beautiful villas sumptiously furnished and waited on hand and foot, This is the place to be pampered. The only interruptions we had were the helicopters landing on the helipad at the Burj . If you want a wonderfully relaxing stay in Dubai book these villas, nothing to compare. Margaret Swansea Wales."
279,,"I've been in Dubai since January for business and will stay until end July. I bumped into this hotel by luck as I wasn't especially looking for an hotel appartment... Service here is always great, and even though it's an hotel, rooms are furnished enough to look like it's home ! And location is very convenient: close to the beach and to main roads, &amp; neighbourhood is full of restaurants and local souqs,So, strongly recommended either for business or leisure !=D"
280,,"Stayed in Oct for 3 nights along with friends and we were all very impressed. Great position for shopping,terrific breakfast,apartment large with plenty of space, well fitted out kichen and includes washing machine and dryer. The only complaint would be that there is no free internet."
281,,"We stayed four nights at the burj. Truly incredible. The staff and the hotel (can I even call it a hotel?) leaves nothing out, and you pay for everything. The other reviews will tell you about all the great amenities so I will focus on those areas that I wish were in the other reviews. this review is for average joes, like us, who once again want to say “been there, done that.” Lastly, First, we are on a country count. We try not to visit the same country/destination twice. And while we will visit Dubai again as a springboard to other Middle Eastern destinations, we will not stay at the burj again, because it is a destination in and of itself. FYI. Location is great and you can walk to the market/mall where there are plenty of restaurants.Breakfast. Nice but average. No mimosas. You would think for $1,500 /night, you could get complimentary Champaign. However, the all you could eat filet was nice and similar to what you would get at LGs or The Cut.Cigar Lounge. I am a cigar aficionado so this was one of the highlights. Ski Dubai—You have to do it. Not Vail or the alps but definitely a conversation piece."
282,,"Stayed in Capitol Hotel for three nights last February on a pleasure trip. This is my second time in this hotel since late 2005 and can say that accommodation + services have gone ten times worse. The furniture is exactly the same except more dated. The reception staff were very very rude and sounded like they're doing you a favor by giving you a room (very arrogant management as well). I was given a room in the 3rd floor, yet I could not sleep before 3 a.m. in the morning from the night clubs' terrible noise (3 of them). The hotel offers a room message service, but in reality it is a disguised service for working girls..!! I have not had any meal in the hotel so I can not comment on the food. For what I paid (USD 200+ per night) I could have enjoyed any 5* beach hotel at jumeirah. A terrible terrible experience. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel to any traveler."
283,,"First to mention - hotel changed its name into Country Club Hotel Dubai.The hotel is not wow, actually nothing to do with all great hotels around Jumeirah, even Deira etc. But for given price we paid it's very good option how to stay in Dubai.The rooms are quite ok - Indian, little overdecorated style, huge, with nice, new bathrooms.The breakfast is good enough to fill stomach in the morning. Reception quite slow and not really helpful. But I wouldn't mind to take my family there at all. (This is my usual criteria for acceptable and not acceptable hotel)The location is not great either, no nice views, just roads and other rather older buildings aroundSo I would say good value for money (we paid 350 AED in July, 400 AED in August 08 for double with breakfast), which is great price for Dubai"
284,,"From the moment we had booked this hotel, we knew we had taken a risk as none of had stayed at this place before. It seemed cheap for Dubai and in a good location. However, from the moment of arrival to the departure our holiday was ruined.The hotel placed us in smoking rooms even though we requested non-smoking due to one of the group being severely asmatic. We also requested rooms above the 4th, this request was also ignored until we decided to complain. At this point we hadn't even checked-in!!The rooms were poor, in every aspect of the word. The decor, the bed, the bathroom, the security, the TV, and even for a bunch of backpackers..this was too much!I would be very careful of using the Safari group this hotel recommends as one of my friend nearly died on the quad biking event! There is NO health and safety code, you simply are given the keys and off you go!!I would never recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family, so please consider an alternative before you book! The Lotus hotel across the road seemed much better."
285,,"We stayed in the Sofitel for seven nights during Easter and were quite happy with our choice, mostly because of the fantastic location, the hotel being adjacent to Deira City Shopping Center. Huge mall with everything you might need. As somebody already wrote, this is a city/business hotel, do not expect to be staying in a beach resort;) The pool area on the roof was OK, althought quite small. The fitness facilities were great. The room was clean, but as a smoking room (for non-smokers) it had unpleasent smell and it felt a bit damp overall. We stayed in the 11th floor in an executive room; don't know how the other rooms measure up. Breakfast was definitely great. The staff of the hotel was not excactly the friendliest, some were even rude. Though this seemed to be somewhat common in shops etc also."
286,,"The city seasons hotel is a10 mns drive from the airport and so very convenient while on a stopover.It is a modern, comfortable and convenient hotel.The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. They are not cheap but I got a very good last minute deal on opodo.co.uk- 50 euros instead of full price of 350 euros, I think.The location is great for the airport but then it s kind of in the middle of nowhere... The closest attraction is Deira shopping center, otherwise it s just building-finished or under construction but that s Dubai...The only think I didn-t like is the coldness of the receptionist who was telling a colleague off while checking me in... Not very welcoming.However, the people at the entrance were very friendly.As I stayed for a few hours only, I didn-t use any of the facilities and therefore cannot comment on them. All I know is that there is a gym and an indoor pool."
287,,"Hotel rooms are Five star but service is far from it!! This is a dry hotel so no bar. You have to walk to Sofitel down the road if you want a beer. Breakfast buffet was ok but the chief cooks your omelette in the Restaurant with no extractor fan so your clothes end up stinking of food every morning, gave up in the end and started taking my breakfast to the room so I wouldn’t smell of food all dayLocation is a nightmare to get to and from cant get a taxi first day took 1hr 40 mins(not even a limo) next day planned ahead this time only an hour and that was booking one with the front desk of the hotel. dont even think of going to the shopping mall to get a taxi 3 hours wait in the afternoons. When returning by taxi, drivers off load you when they find out where your going happened 3 times. Madness the traffic will kill this place if the country doesn’t sort it out some how.Pool in shade in the winter time so no use, gym opens at 9 and closes at 6 so no use if you have been out all day. Traffic is noisy and next to a mosque so call to prayer at 530am if you need an early morning callConstruction site next door to hotel at the moment which is pretty much 24 hours so you get a nice beep beep beep of the crane lift all night.I tried to change hotel but everything was full and company was paying for a 5 star hotel. This hotel does not deserve the title of 5 star even if the rooms do have that 5 star look to them. if you just want room and nothing else for one night it might be ok .One last thing i asked the door man to tell the taxi driver to take me to the VIP lounge at the airport i checked with him at least 4 times to make sure so there would be no mistake, he said YES YES i know i have told him, well guess what? driver went to main terminal and had no clue about the VIP lounge or where it was.In the past i have had great time in Dubai and have thought of working there full time, but this trip has put me off for life, the traffic is a mess and will kill the tourist industry they are trying to develop never again."
288,,"Upon our arrival, the hotel transportation van was already in the airport waiting for us. The van had a great air conditioner, so the hottness of the weather was taken care of just fine. When we got to the hotel we had to wait until about 1:30 before they gave us the key to our rooms which they said will happen on 2 o'clock.THE ROOM :we had 3 rooms, 208, 203 and 214 as we were 8 people. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. There was a decent tv with about 30 channels, covering news, movies, musics and sports, a few of them being Persian channels. The refrigrator didn't seem to be working good though and the room service said that it'll only be able to keep a bottle or two cold! one of the nice things about the room was that it had a digital safe box inside the closet which you could use to keep your money and stuff safely in the room, it even had enough space to store my laptop. There was a sofa for two people and a chair in front of the make up desk. We had three separate beds which were just fine. The air conditioner in the room seemed to be fine as well. The only problem with the room was the sound insulation. I could clearely hear people talking and opening and closing the door to their rooms, which I found really annoying and it woke me up a few times. I think it's the problem with the door as the walls seem to be thick enough. Also, our room (208) seemed to be located right above the Indian night club, which didn't let us sleep until 3:00 a.m the first night, and we had to get ear plugs from a pharmacy. Among our other rooms, the 203 was ok noise wise, and the 214 was above the Persian night club I guess. The floors were G, M, 1, 2, ... and the night clubs and the restaurant were located on the M floor and we were on the 2nd floor. (M stands for Mezanine by the way!) One of the other negative points about the room was the bathroom's water. Even the cold water itself was too hot that made it so hard to take a shower without burning your skin. The bathroom was pretty clean and they cleaned it everyday, but it only had soup, and hair and body shampoo. No lotions or anything else.THE NIGHT CLUBS :The night clubs were not interesting at all. The Indian one was too boring with a few tables and some women dancing on the stage. Although the waiters were quite friendly.The Persian night club, to my surprise had an entrance fee of 100dhs!!! (which also included some fruits and a drink) There were some singers there too who i did not find interesting at all. Among the guests most were men, and there were a few asian looking females who I think were prostitutes, but unlike our previous hotel, they didn't make any moves whatsoever over the men around them, and they'd just sit quietly smoking or sometimes they'd come and dance on the stage. There were a few single Persian women as well... Anyways, it was really boring so I left the club quite early.I didn't check the arabian night club.THE LOBBY :The lobby had a big (46&quot;) LCD and enough sofas, a piano which was unused the whole time, a cafe and an internet pub with 3 really slow computers and an even slower internet connection for a surprising 20 dhs an hour!!!!! The hotel also had an English pub which I didn't try.THE FOOD :The breakfast and lunch was the best thing about this hotel, as most of the food was either Persian or really close to a Persian's taste.Most (if not all) the guests at this hotel were iranians at the time of our stay.So, on the whole it's a good hotel for families considering the reasonable price. But for a single person I'd rather choose a hotel with a good night club or at least near one. I din't like the fact that you had to pay for everything in this hotel, even the computers. I hope this review would help you in making a decision."
289,,The hotel is good. But somehow everything is very relaxed there. We told the reception that smoke was coming out from the oven and they took 30 minutes to send somebody. Its a very clean hotel. They prepared jain food on request. I think one of the best points is that it has an indian restaurant which serves good food. Further they dont have any beef in the hotel. So i will recommend to travellers from india and for people who dont like beef.Further one important thing about diera is the taxi problem. Near the hotel there is a bus stop and trust me it makes sense to travel by bus. The timetable is printed and the buses stick to that time. Further in this area the buses are not crowded so its ok
290,,"never suggest this hotel to anyone.The rooms are dark and underexposed, the A/C not work properly, the room is not clean as you want, its staff are not friendly and helpful. Aweful breakfast and lunch buffet, just for Indians and Pakistanians. The food was aweful."
291,,"Overall, the staying was good. Staff was friendly and always available on time. Rooms were clean, but not as cosy as we expected them to be. The big problem with the restaurant buffet. Too few seats for many people. We had to stand in a queue to get seats and have our dinner. But the food was really great and diversified! Plus a lot of interferance into privacy. We could not bring our friends into our room. Small swimming pool. However, the location of the hotel compensates the abovementioned minuses. Just in front of the Al Ghurair Center, not far from Spinneys and Marks and Spencer and 10 minutes walk from Naser Square."
292,,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.I really liked it.It's new, modern, clean, and have a great location.some rooms have a jacuzzi in it.the best thing about this hotel that it's so quite, it doesn't have a night club, and it doesn't serve alcohol."
293,,"Group work is very nice and cooperative, the rooms very clean and wide, close to shopping and entertainment centers, thanks .I hope to increase the speed of the internet inside the hotel it is very necessary"
294,,"I've stayed in this hotel 4-5 times in the past 2,5 years, have stayed there for 1, 2 and 4 weeks and I have to say that I'm quite happy with it and would try booking it for my next trip to Dubai as well.I'm really not sure where all those negative revies are coming from I've had ONLY 2 unpleasant occasions:1. First time they were supposed to pick me up from the airport but it tokk me forever to go thought passport control so there was noone at the airport arrivals waiting for me. I called the hotel and they told me to take any taxi and they'll pay the bill, which they really did.2. Some other time I arranged (free) transfer back to the aiport with them but it was some odd time in the middle of the night for a red-eye flight so when I checked out there was no transportation waiting. However, the receptionist solved it and 15min later I had my transfer.Well, 2 other slight negative is that they have one very serious-faced waitress (hostess?) in the breakfast restaurant. I think she could act a bit more friendly. Then they also have one rather annoying doorman who grabs your bag from your hands every single time you show up at the entrance, even if they are so small that there is obviously no need for help. A tip beggar, really, kind of annoying.I NEVER had any problems witch check-in or booking or them ignoring my e-mails, quite the opposite: I need visa to enter Dubai (arranged by the hotel) and sometimes my requests are very confusing and changing: my travel dates change, or are pending, or my required visa type changes, or I need to split/combine the bookings.. So, every single time the reply very fast, with all the info I'm asking, with great willigness to jump through all the hoops with all my messy requests, making sure someone else picks up my case immediately if the initial person goes on holiday etc, their &quot;visa manager&quot; always deals with me personally, in e-mails and in person, there's always a cold welcome drink upon arrival etc.Moreover, they are flexible with my check-out times (check out at 9pm with no extra charge), always fresh flowers in my room (with some hotel chocolates and flower petals on my bed), always complimentary bottle of water (not just the first one). Another time they picked up my additional visa charge (charged by coressponding government authorities) despite the screw-up that caused the charge was from my side AND still gave me late check out option at no extra charge...Anyways, my rooms are always decent size, clean, comfortable and well equipped, the staff is very nice and helpful (except for that one serious waitress and that one beggar doorman)... Someone complained about no iron in the room, no alcohol in the hotel and about construction/ugly view. Well, it is Dubai, you know. Meaning, construction everywhere and absence of alcohol - is NORMAL for that city. Sure, there are are hotels with lovely views and/or no construction nearby but those would be in a different price category. Given reality of Dubai as whole Coral Deira has TOTALLY NORMAL price/value ratio.As for the iron, once again - it's Dubai. &quot;Outsourcing&quot; that sort of work is so affordable and widely spread here that noone would imagine that a 4*-5* hotel guest would even consider doing it himself.Location - close to the airport, a couple of decent malls and a handful of nice restaurants. I agree that it's not in the best spot for visiting the main attractions of contemporary Dubai, all the westernized, brand new skyscrapers and all that jazz. But if you want to get a feel of more &quot;real&quot; Dubai, more authentic - and delicious and cheap! -restaurants - then the location is excellent.I'm happy with the hotel and the price, would recommend it and would stay there again."
295,,"we got a good room with balcony. Also very good service. Market place and gold souk was within walking distance.we stayed there for 2 nights. I really loved the hotel and the yummy breakfast they served. only problem was to get a taxi, we had to wait for 10-15 mins."
296,,"Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is quite far away from airport and city centre. Although hotel is in a lovely area. With shopping centre attached to the exec appartments next door. Pool was lovely although a bit hot for middle of the summer. All staff were really friendly, helpful and smiley. The only thing to grumble against was the price of dinner in both restaurants, was just as expensive as each other. Also Price for breakfast was extortionate for a bowl of cereal and some fruit."
297,,"The hotel is very modern and rooms well furnished to a very high standard. Location was good (less than 10mins drive from the airport and right next to a shopping mall complex so a good choice of shopping and restaurants. There is even a large supermarket should you want your own things. The major problem I had was parking my rental car. I parked in the underground car park the first night (arriving at 1am) but the next day security refused to let me park it, they said it had to be valet parked. Discussions with the concierge and others got different answers depending on who you asked, or sometimes different answers from the same person 1 min later: you cannot park yourself. You can park yourself but must be on level P3. You must have a valet parking attendant drive you down to P3 but you can drive out yourself. You can park yourself but must leave the keys with the valet parking attendant.I have only had compulsory valet parking once before, at Hyatt in vancouver - because the then US president, Bill Clinton was staying at the same hotel. In dubai I certainly did not see any serving US presidents!! Worst time was being driven to P1 by the valet parking attendant, taking the keys to my room, then being called and told to get the car moved to P3. The following morning I asked for the keys,and was taken down to the valet parking office, keys were not there, they were back at the front desk!! Staff did not seem to realise that when I leave to work in the morning I want to go down, walk to the car and drive away. Waiting around even for 1min is not acceptable and I do not want any risk of a long wait due to sudden rush of people leaving for work in the morning. On check out my bill had a charge for internet, even through my corporate rate included it (and one night the system knew this and didn't charge, but another night it decided to charge me). They did take the charge off straight away, but check your bills !"
298,,"Everyone at the Crown Plaza was very helpful. The rooms were vey nice and I had a geat view. We booked the Desert Safari through the hotel and was very pleased. The pool area was nice. The internet service in the room was expensive, the business centr was reasonable but not as convenient. The location of the hotal was very good, close to the malls and restaurants."
299,,"No need to add to what has already been written. The accolades for this Hotel speak for themself. My hat is off to The Jumeirah Group. We have *never* had a bad experience in any of their resorts, and have stayed several times. This Hotel chain simply know service level and expectation. We will be back again, and again, and again. Utterly magnificent."
300,,"Date of Vacation: 11th to 18th March 2008.Venue: Deira Town Hotel, Deira, Dubai, UAE.This hotel has friendly staff, the hotel is comfortable and bedroom was clean however the bathroom was very tired with black mildew around the inside of the shower cubicle which had only one door. There are 2 nightclubs on ground floor which ends at 3am so you need to be on the 4th floor. The staff are helpful as long as you ask the questions, if you don't they will not volunteer the information eg If you require a taxi do not stand at front of hotel expecting one to stop however you can use the hotel telephone in reception to ring for one but it took two days of standing for an hour outside the hotel before i asked the staff what to do. The food in the restaurant is only ok. When organising excursions either book in UK or in local agents do not use hotel travel desk as the price is almost double. I booked through an agent for a desert safari which cost 160 Dhms but had I booked in hotel would have been charged 250. Also i did not know until I arrived that there is a courtesy bus to and from the airport, so had to pay for a taxi from airport at midnight. Would have been easier had the hotel arranged for us to be collected."
301,,"We made use of our stopover in Dubai to explore the city for a couple of days. We choose the Delmont for accomodation because it is close to the airport and offers a free shuttle service. Besides it is a good starting point to visit all places of interest in the city (as Dubai is quiet large and temperatures in May are very high, it should be noted that visiting the city by foot is impossible). The staff was friendly and our hotel room was ready for us as early as 7:30 in the morning (when our flight arrived). Thee room was in a good shape and had a comfortable size. Besides a small gym the hotel offers a pool on the roof of the building which is a nice opportunity to refresh. Unfortunatly the swimming pool cloed at 6 pm during our stay. Breakfast was good and appropriate.Conclusion: ideal hotel for poeple wanting to explore Dubai on their journey through with good cost/performance ratio."
302,,"As the title says, this was my husbands 1st full week off work in 3 years &amp; it was well worth saving up for financially so as not to whack it on the credit card. No regrets whatsoever. We had Suite 5: Huge, definitely of 5* quality, Ipod, zoned lighting, electric blinds on floor to ceiling windows overlooking polo fields, aircon, Nespresso machine, fully stocked fridge. Bathroom: Double sinks, sound speakers, large bath, phone &amp; bidet, shower so big I took my coffee in there &amp; it didn't get splashed. Immacculately clean &amp; I look for problems!Food: Rare steaks were mealt-in-the-mouth. We were given a few little tasters that weren't on the menu as a gesture as well such as cauliflower &amp; foie gras soup.Epicure: Tried to order a tiger prawn &amp; rocket salad - it came with spinach instead. Tried to order white toast, they didn't have that either. No issue, just that they are the basics that's all. Plenty of choice on the menu &amp; it is all handmade, good quality. A lot of the locals arrange their own celebrations at Desert Palm as the reputation, service, quality &amp; food is good.Complimentary jetlag massage given at Lime &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the Movies &amp; Munchies Night sitting in the pool in the inflatable armchairs after sunset munching popcorn while watching on a big screen The Italian Job. What a fab idea that was!!!Reception staff gave us the address so the taxi driver knew how to return us safely. I didn't realise until the last day that there were magazines for the taking in Epicure. As we had an horrendously early check-out at stupid-o-clock, we were offered breakfast in bed which was a lovely thought on their part.We'd pre-booked afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar in the Burj Al Arab. Great experience but never did get my coffee that I ordered!"
303,,"I wouldn't really recommend this hotel and wouldn't return there. The rooms were comfortable but the housekeeping were not consistent with cleaning and replacing water etc. The interior of the hotel was clean but the decor was garish and the staff were fairly unhelpful. The pool was small and there is a serious shortage of sun loungers to use. Also, the health club changing facility is very small and there is only one shower to use. The buffet breakfast was disappointing and was not representative of a four star hotel. The only plus side is that there is a free transfer to and from the Jumeirah Beach Resort and Park. The hotel was also in a good location for access to all areas of Dubai."
304,,"I had been in Dubai for 3 days and stayed at this place. It is a nice hotel cum appartment and very very good for asians specially Indians. The rooms are really big, spacious, neat and clean with an equally clean bath. The location of the hotel is also good ie in Meena Bazar. There are plenty of Indian restaurents near by and is also near to Deira. The only turn off is that sometimes the area gets a bit crowded. The breakfast is nice &amp; Suitable for Indians."
305,,Paid less than USD300 for 6 nights without breakfast. Cleaning service for the room good - - I would press the button &quot;pls. make up room&quot; on the phone panels &amp; it was done when we got back. Towel exchange available as needed. Complimentary bottled water x2 (big) in fridge. TV channels limited &amp; some channel had unclear reception. I had to pay for internet service. Shower stall too small. Front desk upon check in was good but the staff on check out needed to brush on her people skills. This is a clean &amp; comfortable enough hotel to stay in so I would come back again at the same price or lower.

2,,"An article from February 24, 2004, included in the Congression Record as well as  urlLink Neil Abercrombie's website , cites the publication Roll Call. It explains how Ayad Allawi set things up to become the interim Prime Minister of Iraq: ===================================================== Iraqi Money Flows by Brody Mullins  Several well-heeled Iraqis who hope to play central roles in Iraq's emerging government have launched lobbying campaigns in Washington to influence the Bush administration and Congress as they work to shape a permanent government in Iraq.  The group of Iraqis, which include three members of the U.S.-created  urlLink Iraqi Governing Council , are spending as much as $100,000 per month on lobbying firms and public relations agents to press U.S. officials to create a modern, democratic government that is not dominated by Islamic conservatives.  ``It's like they are running for president,'' said one U.S. official of the competing public relations efforts in Washington.  The three Iraqis began their public relations efforts in Washington more than a decade after another Iraqi member of the Iraqi Governing Council--Ahmed Chalabi--began cultivating close ties to now-Vice President Cheney and other key administration officials.  According to forms filed with the Justice Department, Ayad Allawi, a member and former president of the Iraqi Governing Council, has begun an expensive lobbying and public relations effort to press U.S. officials to build a modern democratic government that builds on Iraq's existing foundations.  Allawi has already paid more than $300,000 to Washington from  urlLink Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP  to help open doors on Capital Hill and at the White House.  Allawi also hired a  urlLink former U.S. ambassador  to coordinate his Washington effort and a  urlLink New York advertising firm  that once worked for the Beatles to manage his image in the United States.  The public relations effort, which could top $1 million this year, is funded by Mashal Nawab, an Iraqi-born physician who is a ``close friend and admirer'' of Allawi, according to the Justice Department forms.  Adnan Pachachi, another member and former president of Iraq's interim government, has also signed up a Washington public relations firm to help him get his message across to the Bush administration and Congress.  F. Wallace Hayes, working on a pro bono basis for now, will write press releases for the 70-year-old Pachachi that ``promote democracy in Iraq,'' according to the Justice Department forms.  Meanwhile, Baqir Jabor, an Iraqi exile appointed by the United States to run Iraq's housing and construction department, has asked former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) and his influential Washington lobbying firm to help arrange a  series of meetings with the Bush administration during his upcoming visit to the United States.  Officials at Livingston Group said Jabor is not a formal client of the firm. Other details of Livingston's work with Jabor are not yet available because Jabor first asked Livingston for help only last month.  The new public relations campaigns in Washington come as the Bush administration struggles to complete an interim constitution for Iraq by the end of the month in order to turn control of the government over to Iraq this year.  In the past few days, it has become clear that the United States will fail to meet both deadlines.  Over the weekend, the Kurds in northern Iraq--which comprise 20 percent of the country--rejected key parts of the constitution. Meanwhile, Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq, acknowledged last week that it is unlikely that Iraq will be able to hold an election for at least another year.  By hiring lobbyists in Washington, the Iraqi leaders hope to one day play a central role in the emerging government.  The Iraqis who have hired lobbyists are each former exiles who want the United States to create a democratically elected government.  Iraq's Shiites make up as much as 60 percent of the country and are better organized than their political and ethnic rivals, the Kurds and the Sunnis.  The leader of Iraq's Shiite conservatives, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, hopes to schedule quick elections, knowing that he and his allies would dominate the government if elections are held soon.  Allawi, Jabor and Pachachi share another rival in Chalabi. But unlike the Iraqi newcomers to Washington, Chalabi has worked for years in Washington cultivating friendships with key players like Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle.  Since 1986, Shea & Gardner has represented Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress in Washington for about $10,000 a month. One of the partners at Shea & Gardner is James Woolsey, the former CIA director.  Chalabi also gets help from Francis Brooke, a political consultant, and Riva Levinson of BKSH & Associates, the Washington firm founded by Charles Black, a long-time ally of President Bush.  Those contacts have paid off: At this year's State of the Union address, Chalabi sat in the VIP box with first lady Laura Bush.  Chalabi also was one of the few Iraqis permitted to meet face to face with Saddam Hussein in his cell in the hours after his capture in late December.  Chalabi has long been considered the favorite of Defense Department officials to lead Iraq's new government.  However, his star appears to be fading as Pentagon officials question some of the military intelligence he provided before the war and as Iraqis increasingly view Chalabi as a pawn for the United States.  Meanwhile, the State Department is thought to favor Pachachi, while the CIA backs Allawi. His main opponent in Washington is thought to be Chalabi, a distant relative.  Though Chalabi and Allawi both oppose an Iraqi government run by Islamics, they split over the structure of a new secular government.  Chalabi would like to rid the country of anything to do with Hussein's Baath Party, while Chalabi--a member of the Baath Party before it was hijacked by Hussein in the 1970s--believes the new government should be built upon the existing foundations.  ``There are options available to make use of the civil structures that are available in Iraq rather than throwing everything out,'' said R. Paul Stimers of Allawi's lobbying firm, Preston Gates.  Allawi, a neuroscientist by training, survived a vicious assassination attempt in the late 1970s when Hussein allies tried to axe him to death in his sleep. He later became a source of important--and sometimes suspect--intelligence  information to the CIA.  After the war, he was appointed to the interim Iraqi Governing Council and tapped to take charge of security for the country.  In Washington, Allawia and his British benefactor last fall hired Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, to build his base of support among key Members of Congress and the Bush administration.  Theros runs a consulting firm,  urlLink Theros & Theros , with his wife and son out of their home in a leafy section of Northwest Washington.  With a total monthly budget that began at $122,000, Allawi brought on New York public relations agency  urlLink Brown Lloyd James Ltd. --a firm that once represented the Beatles--for $12,500 a month.  For lobbying work, Allawi tapped Washington lobbying shop Preston Gates for $100,000 a month, though the firm has since lowered its monthly retainer to less than $50,000.  According to contracts filed with the Justice Department, the firms will help Allawi ``gain U.S. government support for his policy suggestions for Iraq'' by ``explain[ing] his views on the security and political situation in Iraq.''  Theros, who is making about $10,000 a month from Allawi, plans to attend ``public forums, seminars, events and meetings which represent an opportunity'' to express Allawi's ideas.

3,,"Well I never did remember what I was going to write on Friday and then I got so busy at work that I just never got to blogging about anything.&nbsp; I feel bad, because according to my site meter, I get about 25 visitors a day.&nbsp; Which means 25 people are looking forward to reading about my life.&nbsp; I feel so honored, really...    &nbsp;  So sorry, guys.&nbsp; But now here's a recap of the weekend.&nbsp; It's kinda like VH1's Best Week Ever.&nbsp; I give you the highlights of the weekend without all the boring stuff.    &nbsp;  Friday Steve grilled Steak and we ate that with french fries.&nbsp; It was yummy.&nbsp; Oh wait, that's kinda boring, isnt it...    &nbsp;  Okay so Saturday Steve went to play golf while I waited for the cable guy to come and hook up basic cable in the bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; I would have done it when we hooked up the other tvs, but we had this terribly old television upstairs so there was no point.&nbsp; On the July 4th weekend, Sears had a sale on everything and I got us a new tv for like $75.00.&nbsp; So now with the new tv comes more options and therefore we just HAD to get the cable up there.&nbsp; And besides, it was only a $9.95 installation fee.&nbsp; But wait, it gets better!&nbsp; The cable guy was supposed to come between 11am and 1pm.&nbsp; He was about 20 minutes late.&nbsp; Because he was late, I got the installation for free!&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; Hey, I'll take what I can get, man!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I got so excited about the cable upstairs that I weeded the front garden.&nbsp; Yes, I know you  think  it's unrelated, but&nbsp;watch this...&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the fact that I had to actually get out of my pjs on a Saturday morning and look decent for the cable guy compelled me to actually leave the living room (y'know, since I was dressed an' all.)&nbsp; So&nbsp;I went outside on the porch and&nbsp;was reminded of the weeds since the clover was taking over so much you couldnt see the begonias... It was about time&nbsp;I took care of it, so I did.&nbsp; Ah-HA!&nbsp; See how its all related?&nbsp; At least in  my  head it is.&nbsp; hmmph.    &nbsp;  Moving right along.&nbsp; Steve had gotten me tickets to see Alanis Morissette&nbsp;and Barenaked Ladies at the PNC Bank Arts Center for my graduation and Saturday night was the concert.&nbsp; He also got me her new album which I wasnt impressed with but I didn't have the heart to tell him until I played it for him and about half way through he says, ""Can we shut this shit off?""&nbsp; HAHAHA!&nbsp; You gotta love this guy!&nbsp; So basically we were really hoping that BNL would go on first which they did.&nbsp; They were really awesome!&nbsp; Such fun, I tell ya.&nbsp; Always look like they're having a blast on stage.&nbsp; I'm also in love with   urlLink  Ed Robertson   .&nbsp; mmmm-mmm.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Aside: Steve and I have this thing: if we had the possibility of having sex with a famous person, we'd forgive each other.&nbsp; It's only right since the opportunities dont come around that often, right?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; So John Cusack was at the top of my list but now I think I've replaced him with Chad and Ed.&nbsp; John is still in the top three.&nbsp; You'll have to ask him who's on his list... I know Halle Berry is probably #1, but I dont know about the rest.&nbsp; It's cool though.&nbsp; I think he's got good taste.&nbsp; ;-)     &nbsp;  But I digress.&nbsp; BNL rocked out and then Alanis came on.&nbsp; YAWWN.&nbsp; I mean, she sounded pretty good, but she was so boring.&nbsp; Just standing at the&nbsp;microphone singing her songs.&nbsp; Saying the obligatory, ""Thank you New Jersey!"" once in awhile...but overall?&nbsp; Eh.&nbsp; So after ""You Oughta Know"" and giggling at the 40-something, bald, probably drunk, fat guy&nbsp;pumping his hands in the air and screaming out the song, we left.&nbsp; (So what do you think his favorite line in the song is?&nbsp;  'It was a slap in the face/how quickly I was replaced/and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?' &nbsp; hehe)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Another aside: According to I Love the 90's on VH1 (yeah I watch a lot of VH1...AND?!), and a friend of mine confirmed it, that song was written after Dave Coulier broke her heart.&nbsp; The guy from Full House that can make the Bullwinkle voice.&nbsp; For some reason a passionate relationship with that guy is just kinda hard to picture...and its also kinda gross...       &nbsp;  So anyway, moving right along.&nbsp; Us Northern East Coast dwellers had a lot of rain on Sunday.&nbsp; And I have cable in the bedroom so guess who didn't get up that early yesterday?&nbsp; Thats right, children.&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; I was in my pjs all day and it felt pretty darn good.&nbsp; Get this.&nbsp; I showered and then put other pjs on.&nbsp; I was going for the long haul.&nbsp; Wrastled up some grub and plopped on the couch for some quality time with Steve and Showtime On Demand.&nbsp;    Since we haven't had Showtime all this time, I thought I'd catch up with   urlLink  The L Word   .&nbsp; Its all about gorgeous lesbians in LA and their gorgeous friends.&nbsp; So Steve was into it.&nbsp; (snicker!)&nbsp; We got sucked into it and watched like, 4 episodes in a row.&nbsp; Then we ate some more.&nbsp; Then we watched some more tv.&nbsp; Then we ate some more.&nbsp; Somewhere in there I did the laundry and made a few phone calls and even IMed a little.&nbsp; Then we went to bed where I proceeded to watch more television.&nbsp; Then I fell asleep and dreamt about gorgeous lesbians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ABOUT THEM&nbsp;on their own... Not with me, you&nbsp;perverts... Like I was still watching episodes and predicting how it would all come out...    &nbsp;  And lastly the piece de resistance!&nbsp; I found my friend Rose.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; Her birthday was yesterday and I ALWAYS call her for her birthday.&nbsp; We've been friends since we were 9.&nbsp; But we kinda went our separate ways and keep finding each other along the way... its cool.&nbsp; She's one of those people that no matter how much time passes you can talk like it was just yesterday.&nbsp; I love huh.&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, I tried calling her cell and it was disconnected.&nbsp; So was her phone!&nbsp; So luckily her mother still&nbsp;has the same number since we were 9, and I called her.&nbsp; She told me Rosie moved to Miami and gave me the number.&nbsp; AWW.&nbsp; She was all like, ""AWW, YOU ALWAYS CALL ME!!!""&nbsp; We talked for an hour.&nbsp; Love huh!!&nbsp; Y'know I dont mind losing people that didn't mean much, but when there's a connection there, you always gotta find a way to hook up and keep them in your life in some way or another.    &nbsp;  So there you have it folks, the weekend.&nbsp; It's funny how I feel like I really didn't do much at all, and yet I can blab about it this much.&nbsp; hee hee!"

16,,"Hi all,  Interesting to see a discussion after a long time. I certainly agree with Rajesh on many of his points. Yesterday I faced a similar problem only this time; I had to translate from Tamil to English. I found it difficult. I have not completed it yet.   The political parties are making a hue and cry over declaring Tamil a national language. If it is declared so, then will other states start teaching Tamil? Definitely not. Soon we might have 30-35 national languages. Think of the country, already with Hindi as the national language, you and I cannot understand what someone from Bihar is saying or vice versa. I think those in Bang. can explain how it feels to speak Tamil in Karnataka. I really wonder how Valli & Sinduja are faring in an alien land.   As Rajesh had said, it is up to us. But the problem is that people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone. So, what they do is that they try to adopt foreign customs without understanding what they really mean. But they also want their children to be culturally attached to our values. This creates confusion in minds of children. They don't know what to follow and end up following nothing. They know neither Tamil nor English. I remember a scene from the movie 'Minnale'. Madhavan, Vivek and a few of his friends will be having a thanni party. One of them will start off in English. Then Vivek will ask him to write a leave letter. Hope you remember that scene. It starkly portrays the modern generation. That includes you and me.   I know a lot of Anglo-Indians, lots of close and dear friends. I found out that most of them really follow the values of Tamil culture. They find it better than their own culture.   As for Tamil as a language, No political party can lay claim to it. It belongs to the people.   Bye,  ÃÃÃÂ¿ÃÃ ÃÃÂ¿Ã   P.S. if the above line appears as junk, it is due to the problems that Tamil faces, just as many dialects being present in Tamil, there are several fonts for Tamil. I remember a few years back, there were talks of creating a unified font for Tamil, I don't know if it has been done yet. If someone knows of it, then we can use it to display a few messages in Tamil. The above line is my sign in Tamil. Bye, expecting other views from everyone."

How much do I get cut off>? hmm....prolly only an inch or so, cuz  people  like my hair long so they can play with it.  After dinner, Joey came over for a while and we played outside.

If I had known how many more tests and  reading assignments I'd have throughout life, I would have stayed in  school!  But seriously, the man who gave us the work to do knows what he is  talking about. I knew that I wanted him to marry us after hearing just  one of his sermons at church. The sermon was topical and cogent without  being overly ""preachy"". So practical was his approach as to make  perfect sense to anyone.

Suddenly it's not funny or witty, just forced and boring. It's like your brain had this one window of opportunity to get this idea out and now that window is closed forever.

26,,"""Proud member of the vast right-wing conspiracy"" ~Unknown    Forgive my morals, for they have led me to this place and time, unto this topic.  I have to say that I am sorry and if I insult anyone, tough! I know what I believe and if you disagree you can email me, however let me say you will not be able to change my mind.    I was watching a special on Tech TV pertaining to the rather large problem of people pirateing music off of the internet.  I have to wonder why people do this.  People just do not seem to understand that it is STEALING!  If you download a song for free off of the internet, rather than that forign concept called BUYING it, the people who put their time and effort in creating that make nothing, nada, not one red cent!!!  I know people who wouldn't walk into their local convienience store and steel a candy bar, but they persist in downloading tons of pirated music, movies, and games from the interenet...why?    Now, God bless the music industry, those who have downloaded thousands of stolen songs are getting sued!  GO MUSIC INDUSTRY!!! The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is persisting in suing those who are guilty of steeling.  From what I understand there will be no jail time, but monetary compesation will be sought.    Whatever your opinion is, whatever you believe about his anomaly, there will be no mistaking what I believe.  Why is it that people are comfortable committing crimes when they can commit them from the comfort of their own homes?  Why are people willing to steel if they think they're safe from persecution?  Does the population of the pirates not realize that their IP addy can be tracked, the government CAN find you, you are NOT safe from persecution,  you CAN be found and sued!!!  Get it though your thick, criminal heads, this is not okay!  ~Kristyn"

38,,"""All right,"" Damien said as he hurried up the stairs to the rooms where the Snow family and Joel lived above their store.  The bathroom was the second to last room at the end of the hall, right next to Damien's bedroom. He closed the door behind him, not bothering to lock since there was only Joel around. As he kicked off his flip flops, Damien also threw his beach towel into the clothes hamper beside the sink. The he finally pulled down his swimming trunks which were still wet and made a squeaky sound when brushed against the skin of his legs.  Those were also tossed in the clothes hamper. Damien stepped into the shower stall and turned the water on. A quick spray of cold water hit him before it finally turned warm.   Maybe we'll catch a movie on Pay-Per-View , the boy thought as he squeezed out some shampoo from a bottle that was close to being empty.  His face wore a happy expression as he thought of spending time with his big brother without his parents around to remind him that it was time to go to bed.  ""I have him all to myself.""  While Damien worked up a lather and scrubbed furiously to get the clorine out of his hair, he noticed how good it felt to have the warm water running down his prepubescent body after such a long day of carefree play. After rinsing his hair, Damien reached for the soap and when his mind wandered to thoughts of Joel he suddenly got a visual in his mind of Joel taking a shower. The boy's face burned with embarressment at the idea of such a thing.  ""No... why am I thinking that?""  The bar of soap dropped from Damien's hands. He reached down to pick it up and tried to banish such thoughts of Joel from his mind, having no idea what caused them in the first place.  ""What's wrong with me?"" Damien whispered to himself as he rubbed his soapy hands over his body, cleansing physically despite his dirty mental state of mind."

It is that interplay between the technical and the social that gives both C and Unix their legendary status. Programmers love them because they are powerful, and they are powerful because programmers love them. David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale, perhaps put it best when he said, &#8220;Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity.&#8221; Dr Ritchie's creations are indeed beautiful examples of that most modern of art forms."
43,,"Semester 1, Week 7, Day 4.   Classes today.  Gained popularity (not) in Animal Minds by accusing a philosopher of either offering definitions or begging the question.  (Got told it was a difficult paper and even teacher was having difficulty with it.  Not convinced....)  We have been given some easier papers now.  I have no idea what I am going to write my essay on.  Saw Dirk (managed to catch him) and asked if I could see him about my oral presentation.  He said he could see me on Monday 3rd.  I said that this was a bit unacceptible seeing I was giving it on May 10 and practicing on May 5.  So I am seeing him next Tuesday (27th).  Phew.  Saw my little thesis poking out from beneath some other stuff.  Dirk said he hadn't even flicked over the front cover yet.  I could not help but say, ""That's not surprising.""  Gained popularity in Value Theory by offering ideas that teacher thought were interesting.  Velleman (him again) has this idea that what makes sense for us to do next should cohere with our lifes' stories.  But this doesn't give us any reason to act for other people.  So I suggested that we should act in order to help other's life stories cohere, or to add to humanity's life story.  That was the second last class, I have no idea what I am going to write my essay on.  But, best of allness....  Wrote to  urlLink Simon Keller  (who wrote ""How do I love thee?  Let me count the properties?"" - i.e. a big big merit account, properties kinda guy) yesterday, on Dirk's suggestion.  Dirk said that the article came out of his honours thesis.  He obviously did alright to get into Boston and stuff.  Anyway... asked Simon if he'd be interested in reading my little thesis draft.  He has written back (already) and said that he would.  He said:  Thanks for getting in touch, and yes, I'd be very happy to have a look at your thesis. Send it through. One warning - I've been writing a little more on some of this stuff, and so I might hit you with some draft material too.  How neat is that?  So I might forgive the fact that he goes for  urlLink Geelong .  Invention for the day: Supervisor Speed.

44,,"Hello my dear readers and welcome to office time with Alison.  Since I sit in an office all day with very little to do, I have chosen to spend this valuable time with you, the reader.  For what you are reading is no book, nor part of a book, it is a man, flesh and full-blooded, it is I....who knows who wrote that?  If you do, leave me a note so everyone can see how smart you are!  Ok, today we will talk about the following: Ascension Parish Traffic Court The reality show FAME Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus My summer reading  Let us begin with traffic court.  Now for those of you who remember, back in February, Bobby and I witnessed an accident on the interstate in which a girl about my age ran into the back of a truck at about 85mph.  She wrecked her friend's beautiful Mitsubishi Spyder and was also late for sorority church as a result of this accident.  The girl thinks that she fell asleep at the wheel and woke up when she crashed.  The two were very obviously coming home to Baton Rouge from a rough night on Bourbon (they had the stamps on their hands still to prove it).  Well, a few months later, Bobby and I get subpoenas that we need to appear in court to testify for the state on July 24 at 9am.  That is today.  So we begrudgingly get up at 7am to go to Gonzales (about an hour away) for this hearing.  We get there and the girl who is on trial does not show up!  So here we are in Gonzales at 9am for this case and the defendent is nowhere to be seen.  Well alrighty then, we get released and head home by 930am.  What a waste of half a tank of gas and three hours of my life.  But we did get thanked sincerely by all the Ascension parish deputies (I think it took about 4 of them to operate the metal detector)  So anyway, we go grab some lunch and head to work, which is where I am now.    So since this girl never showed up, there is now a bench warrant our for her arrest and we still have no idea what she was being charged with in the first place.  That is the really shitty part about it all.  At least we thought we would find out something exciting about what she was charged with, but alas, we got nothing.  Next hot topic (I love that store!) today is the reality show FAME.  Now many of you know that I liked American Idol, I tolerated Joe Millionaire and I was hooked on For Love or Money.  Well last night I watched FAME for the first time, just in time for the season finale.  All I have to say about that crappy show is that it was so OBVIOUSLY RIGGED.  There was no way that those people did not know who was going to win from the onset and that was so blatantly obvious it is nauseating.  Not only that, but the guy who won did not deserve to win based on what I saw.  Granted, I have only seen the show once, but Shannon had sooooo much more talent and personality than he did and it is sick that he won over her.  Also, if you did not know you were going to win and have to sing a particular song, how would you happen to have absolute perfect choreography for it as you sang???  Hmmmm....  And now for a circus update!  I am going to the circus on Friday!  I am so excited about this because I have not been to the circus in at least 15 years.  When I was young, my grandparents used to take me and my sisters all the time.  Now I get to go with my sister and my niece, her boyfriend and his daughter and of course, Bobby gets thrown in there too.  Hey, I figure since we did the baseball last week, it's time for the circus this week.  I think he is at least a little bit excited about going, though not nearly as much as I am.  But it's all good because I know it will be a good time for all!  And finally, my summer reading.  Yes, since I am going to be student teaching in the fall, I have to complete all the summer reading that was assigned to the students.  Probably not a good sign that I have not yet started on any of the books!  I mean, what would happen if the teacher did not do the summer reading?  I bet that would make for a great start, huh?  Maybe I should hit the Barnes and Noble on the way home today...after all, I only have a month and a day left...  Oh well, that covers all the outlined topics for the day.  Allow me also to say welcome home Candace and congrats to those of you graduating this summer....Justin, Eric, and Amanda.  Also good luck to Miss Lisa on her final tomorrow!  Hope you all enjoy the rest of your Thursday!"

68,,"Here's a bigger chunk of the quote from above: The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else.  Teddy Roosevelt in the Kansas City Star, May 7, 1918 Here's a couple more. I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.   James Madison, June 16, 1788 Liberty has never come from the government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of government. The history of liberty is the history of resistance. The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it.  Woodrow Wilson Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.  Ronald Reagan, March 2, 1977 (Obviously speaking about himself) The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.  James E. Carter There is nothing wrong in America that can't be fixed with what is right in America.  William Clinton The more I study it [the Constitution], the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and happiness to humanity.  Calvin Coolidge, 1929 We Americans have no commission from God to police the world.  Benjamin Harrison The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.  George Washington, Treaty of Tripoli, 1796 Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law.  Thomas Jefferson, February 10, 1814 War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed.  William McKinley, March 4, 1897 Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.  Harry S. Truman Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, in a final sense, [is] a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  Dwight Eisenhower, April 16, 1953 Evil acts of the past are never rectified by evil acts of the present.  Lyndon B. Johnson, July 21, 1964  And, Dubya, I'll let you get the last word. If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier  so long as I'm the dictator.  George W.

In realpolitik the USA is doing what it needs to do to maintain its favoured position in the global arena. If it were to act ""nice"" and not pursue what is in its interests then there would be anarchy in their home country. The citizens of the United States would reach for their guns (which they are entitled to do . . .  I'm not gonna get started on that one) if there was ever a substantial drop in the quality of life that they have been accustomed. Providing meaningful help to other nations that wouldn't doom them as economic vassals of America would reduce the United States quality of life and in a way, the American politicans would be failing their citizens by not providing them with the best possible life.

As I remember correctly, this is the time when Caramon was convincing Raistlin to practice sword fighting with him for his own protection but Raistlin said no.  Raistlin was right though.  All of us has a sword that needs to be hammered into shape before it could be a very good sword.  It needs to be carefully crafted.  If we hurry in shaping our swords, it could never be a good weapon.  It would break easily when battle arises and we would be left with nothing to defend ourselves.  To shape our swords needs time and patience.  We should rush it because it will not be of any use if we did.  It needs to be molded carefully so that it would be the kind of shape that we want our swords to be.  It needs to be handled with care so that we won't hurt anybody with it.  We mustn't be careless with it because it's a powerful weapon.  We have different kinds of swords that needs shaping and wielding.  It is up to us to see to it that we mold it and handle to either help other people or use for our own gain."

And it does. &nbsp;My dad makes fun of me because when I try to make a basket with a wadded up piece of paper, I usually throw it horribly wrong, but it&#8217;ll hit the side of the bookcase just right so that it bounces in. &nbsp;That&#8217;s how my life goes.           &nbsp;         I guess maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so good at photography. &nbsp;So much of it is based on luck. &nbsp;You always hope that you lucked out and clicked the shutter at exactly the right time.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a shooting strategy called the &#8220;hail mary&#8221;, where you hold your camera up over your head to get a better angle, and you pray that you get it right. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m lucky, so more often than not, I do get the shot.           &nbsp;         I&#8217;m lucky because I never studied for a chem or history test, and I still ended up with and A in both classes. &nbsp;           &nbsp;         I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;Its really weird. &nbsp;It just seems like everything falls together for me, just the way its supposed to. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t decided whether or not this is a good thing.

82,,"I'm in one of those moods...the kind where time seems kind of slow, in a good way, and everything is nice and peaceful, and I just kind of...float...from place to place.  Like I am on a cloud!  If that makes any sense...  These past couple of days have been interesting.  I saw some things I never thought I'd see...my grandmother crying being one of them.  Completely broken down...not even caring that people heard her call her Momma...I just can't...relay what it meant to me.  Some things don't need to be marred with words, like the rest of the funeral.  I'll just leave you with that...it was sad, yes, but beautiful in so many ways.  So many thoughts I am having...or I have had...and I don't think I could put them into words.  It's weird like that...I suppose...  Yesterday, before I left, I was in a horrible mood.  I was angry, sad, frustrated...and I just didn't want to deal with people.  When my mom first picked me up, I think that she and Brian could see that I was in a bad mood.  But after a while, they cheered me up, I got better, and I realized why I miss my family so much.  My brother, for one.  He is so adorable, and he is only a year younger than me.  He is really goofy or silly, or whatever he is...and he made me laugh so much.  My mom talked to me about a lot of things, and I just got to tell her about school and the such.  It was nice.  My grandmother.  She is such an amazing person.  I hope I never have to see her sad again.  I got to talk to her a lot yesterday and today too.    The way my family came together and supported each other just made me thankful to have a family like them.  We may not see each other just a whole lot, but everyone is there for each other when they need to be.    Sooo, anyway, in some other ground breaking news, I went to sleep at 9:30 last night.    9:30  !!!  I don't even remember the last time I went to bed that early!  Certainly not sooner than about 7 months ago.  The last time I went to bed  before midnight  was at least 3 months ago.  I woke up this morning, and I wasn't even tired!  And I had a thought that maybe this was how I was supposed to feel every morning...it was nice.  I think perhaps I will start trying to go to bed earlier.  So, tonight I am going to the haunted house at Bruce (where all the music majors live) and then tomorrow it's back to Arlington for the weekend!  Wooooooo!    -Lisa"
83,,"Huwaat???Tapos na bakasyon?   Isang malaking bangungot ito. June 1 na pala.Baket parang wala mashadong nangyari sa bakasyon ko? Pinili ko na ngang huwag magturo nung summer kasi gusto ko (a)magpahinga (b)magenjoy ng bakasyon (c)makarecover sa bad lecture experience ko last sem (d)mag-aral magdrive at (e)mag-isip kung paano ako gagraduate sa MS ko. Pag iniisip ko ngayon kung may nagawa ba ako sa limang sinabi ko,parang wala pang 10% ang natapos ko. Pahinga ba kamo? Kakaiba ang bakasyon ko kasi halos pumupunta rin naman ako sa skul linggo-linggo dahil sa mga meetings.Tapos, nung simula ng May,napirmi naman ako sa bahay kasi nagbaksyon si Marge sa Sorsogon.Ang naging labas tuloy, taong-bahay ako.Ilang linggo din akong nakipag-mabutihang loob sa mga kawali, plato, baso, kutsara't tinidor at kay Joy dishwashing paste.Natuto na rin ako magwalis at mag-mop ng kwarto ko araw araw. Natuto na rin ako maglaba at mamlansta kahit damit ko lang. Natuto rin ako mag-ihaw at mag-luto ng sarili kong pagkain. Ang Hatol: nadomesticate pala ako nitong bakasyon kaya di gaano nakapahinga.  Kung sa pagenjoy naman ng bakasyon, ayos lang naman. Nagkaroon ng 2 major parties ang barkada kasi una, birthday ko nung April tapos matapos ang 2 linggo, si Alvin naman ang nagdiwang ng birthday.Meron din naman mga ilang ""minor gimiks"" kung saan saan. Ito ata ang masayang phase ng bakasyon ko. Gumagala ako kung saan-saan. Yun nga lang, nauubos ang pera ko. May isang insidente pa nga na naka 4k ata ako sa gastos sa mall. Ngeerk. Buti na lang may sweldo pa ako hanggang end ng May. Whew! Tapos,nung weekend lang, nagdecide kami na maghuling hirit sa bakasyon kaya nagpunta kami sa Baguio.(Ireserba ko na lang sa ibang post ang Baguio pics at story)Ang Hatol: Naenjoy ko naman ang bakasyon sa abot ng aking makakaya at sa abot ng aking bulsa.   Sa aspeto ng recovery sa lecture experience, ok na ako. Tanggap ko nang hindi ako marunong magturo at nagkalat ako last sem. Kakahiya nga pero wala akong paki. Sana lang wag na maulit (kahit nanganganib ata akong magturo uli ng lec sa susunod na sem) at medyo may ideya naman na ako kung san ako sumobra at nagkulang.Ang Hatol: Kinakabahan na naman ako kasi maglelecture na naman ata ako.  Yung sa MS, mejo naayos ko na nga ata ang direksyon eh. Binigyan na nga ako ng himala ng Diyos para maka-bangon at makipagbati kay Sir Wilson. Sana nga lang tuloy-tuloy na kasi kelangan ko nang grumadweyt ASAP.Pero malaking kapanatagan ng loob pa rin na di na ako mababaliw sa pagiisip kung paano ako ""babalik"" sa lab. Ang Hatol: Mejo matino ang kinahinatnan nitong issue na ito. Yung sa driving naman, nagkataon na di talaga ako nakahawak ng manubela kahit minsan ngayong bakasyon. Una dahil si kuya Joey ay umuwi ng Baguio at halos isang buwan siya andun. Ang Hatol: bahala na si batman. Siguro di talaga ako isinilang para mag-drive.Wahehehe. Hmm, bukod sa mga nasabi ko, di ko na talaga maisip baket parang ang bilis ng bakasyon. Nawala na lang siya unti-unti.Siguro kung di pa ako nakalabas ng Maynila kamakailan, lalo akong magwawala. Baket lagi na lang bitin ang bakasyon!!!??? Nakakabaliw isipin pero pasukan na naman talaga. Isang sem na naman itong aantayin ko matapos."
84,,"I was walking through my living room, getting lilly ready for her swim lessons, when I began to feel faint. I could feel the demons hands reaching out from behind me, aiming to snare me by my stomach, returning from this mornings dreams. I clutched my latest book to my chest, but it was too light. I felt like I was going to float off the ground and end up falling again. I laid the book down and grabbed the kitchen counter, waiting for my head to catch up with the rest of my body, while I calmed my breath and my racing pulse. My little necklace jingling all the while. My stomach still aflutter. Today could have gone better."

86,,"The first step to turning your life around is getting rid of this negative belief that you can't do anything or that you're helpless. How can you do that? Often the reason that people say they can't do something is that they've tried things in the past that haven't worked. But remember - and I've used this phrase again and again throughout my life.   Your past does not equal your future.     What matters is not yesterday but what you do right now. So many people are trying to drive into the future using a rearview mirror to guide themselves! If you do that, you'll crash. Instead you must focus on what you can do today to make things better.  If you look at any of the most successful people in history, you will find this common thread: They would not be denied. They would not accept no. They would not allow anything to stop them from making their vision, their goal, a reality.   No problem is permanent.   urlLink   No problem affects my entire life.   urlLink   This, too, shall pass if I continue to take massive, positive, constructive action.   My message to you is simple, and in your heart you know it's true: Massive, consistent action with pure persistence and a sense of flexibility in pursuing your goals will ultimately give you what you want, but you must abandon any sense that there is no solution. You must focus immediately on the actions you can take today, even if they are small ones."
87,,"Current mood:  glad and appreciative of peaceful solitude  Currently listening to:  Yeah Yeah Yeahs - ""Maps""   I love this song.    Life (even out of the jungle!) has scoowampled to be pretty hectically busy even though summer vacation landed its long sought-after bum in my way finally; nonetheless, I've been having much fun. Yesterday I gots me butt majorly kicked at bowling, but 'twas very good times-ly. (SHUT UP. Yes, you know I'm talking to you if you're you, you.)  Today was Orlando Jr.'s graduation party. I'm copiously proud of him for round-about obtaining his diploma. His next intendment is the army; he's already set to leave on August 26, and I pride and respect him for picking himself up and realizing that he can make it through something in life. I honestly believe in him and think he will do great.   Otherwise, the baby rescued me... Although the food was ambrosial and I ate far more than I should have (even my aunt admitted that I have, indeed, gained weight *insert frown here*), the actuality of being present was asphyxiating. My nuisance revolved around innerving morons, mainly. Because this was a supposedly more intimate party than what things like these usually turn out to be, Orlando had but a few friends over, and their parental units unfortunately either decided to tag along or were officially invited. Certain witches that Aunt Juliana appeared to befriend were gossiping to no end. I realize it may sound as though I were doing the same right now, but I was highly irked because they were nettlesome without minding their own flaws and businesses. A guy present, likely 22 or 23 years old, had a 7-month-old baby. They criticized him in any way possible behind his back, and that really angered me. First of all, the guy was incredibly nice, and secondly, I thought he was doing a good job. The baby is healthy, and he takes care of it and his significant other he had the baby with (I don't know whether he's married). I respect the simple fact that he and the girl are working and sticking together, and he really seemed as though he were a good dad. It was brilliant in the literal sense of the word to observe the light that infested his face every time he saw Riley, the baby. The witches ridiculed his job and his decisions on raising the baby and anything that could eventually catenate onto such topics. Grrr!!!  Therefore, the only other alternative was transfering to the scorchingly hot inferno that was outside-- anything but gossip!! There, the one thing that I truly despise for people to do to me was done to me. The present group of ""adults"" seemed very good at patronizing me and crushing any idealism I might have managed not to lose priorly. However, they didn't succeed in the latter beyond an extent. I feel as though I shouldn't listen to anything that comes out of their mouths as they all screwed up their lives. Besides that, they flat out told me that all I should be concerned with is making money, which is against anything I've ever believed. Surely, money is nice, and I do want to be able to sustain myself, but it is absolutely not the most important thing to look out for. Call me crazy, but I maintain that it is possible to find something to do with one's life that can truly make one rejoice. Here's an even crazier idea: I'm going to find something that applies to me so,  and  I'm going to embrace it. So, ha! There is a dedication on an AMV: ""For everyone who never learned to give up hope"". It's too bad that so many people learn to give up hope. I'm trying really hard not to be one of them.  Anyway, things got a lot better once the plethora of ignoramuses started departing. We and the fellow with the baby were the last to leave. The baby was one of the coolest babies I've ever come across! She is very intelligent and interesting. She loves food, and she investigates things more than ""normal babies"" seem to. She doesn't cry a lot, and she is relatively happy. Finally, she is a tryer. She almost started walking and actually succeded in standing up on her own as we were cheering her to try, an idea she was fast to seize. Yay for clever babies!!!      I might should could would maybe attempt cleaning the jungle a bit more, maybe. Ren Fest with a Kat tomorrow! Yay!"
88,,"In my effort to maintain my fitness, and attempting to burn off some calories from monday's extravaganza, I decided to supplement my morning run with an afternoon power walk.  I got more than I bargained for.  About a mile away from home, Kendall started going nuts, and ran out in the middle of the road. I pulled her back, thinking it was just a squirrel or a deer, which it normally is. I looked over to see what was driving her so insane. It was two small kittens. In the middle of nowhere, on the side of the road.  Once I acknowledged  their presence, they ran across the street towards me. Kendall was licking her chops, thinking they were a snack. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just leave them there in the middle of the road. So, with Kendall growling and leaping around like a kangaroo, I scooped them into my arms and headed for home. It was rather difficult to juggle two small kittens in my arms and keep Kendall from devouring them, but I made it home with my new little friends. I know I can't keep them, as much as I want to. It sickens me to think of how or why they ended up there, on the side of a country road. But I'd like to think that I was meant to walk that way today, and I was meant to find little Merry and Pippin. (yeah, I am a dork.)  Not the question remains- what to do with them. It is clear that with Kendall, having a cat (let alone 2) Is not a possibility. Not to mention the fact that my mom's landlord looked less than thrilled when I came home with my new little friends. The animal shelter was not open by the time I got back. Part of me wants to take them down there tomorrow morning, but my dad suggested that I try to give them away at the farm this weekend. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to get too attached. A lot of it also depends how kendall handles the rest of the evening.  I must be an animal magnet or something. Two or three years ago, I stumbled across a kitten in a hotel room in Meridian, Mississippi on my way to New Orleans. I hope Mississippi Frodo is doing well....  Ok, I am going to go check on the little ones.... rock on. And if you are a local and know anyone who wants a kitten, e mail me or leave a comment."
89,,"I rule.  Its over, and apparently no one but me noticed how incredibly terrorized I was by the presentation I gave.  Ive been nervous in front of a crowd before, but never have I had this reaction.  Lets take a look  I started out well.  Casual enough, not just reading but making eye contact and adlibbing.  Then came the meat of the presentation.  Of course, I cant actually think while I read aloud, so I have no idea if I spoke English or what.  The audiences faces let me know they were following, interested even.  Then the sweat started.  A warm night in a stuffy room didnt help matters.  Nor did the thick wool black- sweater I was wearing.  I wiped my brow.  So the thing was winding down to a close, and with the end of the second page I turned to the last.  But I shuffled the first page to the middle of the stack, so when I turned I saw *another* full page in front of me.  GULP-  that wasnt the look of the final page the last time I looked.  I hesitated and figured it out in time for it to go unnoticed, but I laugh about it now.  Like a recurrent nightmare that Im soon to have.  The Presentation that Never Ends!!  (cue sound: screaming dame lifted from any B-horror movie)  (is it redundant to say horror movie and B-movie together?)  So Im starting to think to myself, What if I stopped the presentation right now?  Skipped a paragraph or two?  I did that once in Moukhlis class  The sweating is now well underway.  The faintness starts setting in; faint like the last time I gave blood and went into a mini state of shock.  And the nausea.  Oh yes the vision becomes tinged with green in anticipation of the contents of my stomach about to appear on the notes in front of me.  this is the part of the presentation where I grasped the podium for support, both physically and to center my mind on something real.    That was it.  people asked questions, we let Chris answer for us (Anne and I are more afraid of actually speaking  we were both spent by the end of our 15 minutes).  So it told us we did good.  I know we did.  Dawn acknowledged how much time we spent working on this, having seen us stay after last week together as well as overhearing our groups conversation about our last meeting together that lasted all day yesterday.  Its over and we did good.  And most importantly, I stepped up to the plate in a graduate class and didnt shit my pants.  I didnt have an anxiety attack (before the actual act), and I didnt loose any sleep.  Bravo.  Oh, and I thought critically and produced valuable insights.  Now, I shall smoke a bowl and wet my whistle with vodka.  As if I need a method to relax."

One of my only IB classes is also the dumbest.  All we did was go to the library for (get this)  ""Freshman Library Orientation.""   Librarian:  All righty folks, this is how you access the Internet from the library.  You open the laptop, sign in, and double click the icon that says  Internet Explorer .

94,,"This Blogger page is starting to shape up and feel a little more like home. I still can't get the margins and box widths set to my satisfaction though.  Yesterday was productive and I finished the window air conditioner installation. I had to manufacture a fill-in panel to keep the cool air in and the bugs and hot weather out. Everything went perfectly, right up until I tried to drill screws through the steel frame of the window to mount the cover.  Who knew there was concrete poured into those window frames when they were installed? I wrecked 3 drill bits in the space of a couple minutes! My plan was of course to drill 1/8"" holes into the frame and use sheet metal screws to hold the cover in place. But run a drill bit that size with a 1/2"" drill motor through the metal and into the concrete and suddenly you own a drill bit that won't drill through cheese. Crap! I did manage to get enough holes drilled to secure the cover with the help from my friendly caulking gun and some adhesive in a tube.  Its not as good as I engineered it but it acceptable. Its painted and not leaking and the ac unit itself works very nicely."

98,,"Ben and Jen    Does anyone know the plot of ""Gigli""? I was watching the previews on TV and I couldn't exactly pin down what the movie was about. I got the feeling that J-Lo was some kind of gangster woman, maybe Al Pacino's daughter, and that Ben was a hired hitman, or possibly mob enforcer.   Apparently, J-Lo plays a lesbian mob assassin. Ben plays a hired hitman.   I'm genuinely torn as to what the funniest part of this movie will be:   1. That they digitally un-hanced J-Lo's booty for the promotional pictures. Her ass is represented as significantly smaller then real life.  2. Ben and J-Lo fell in love during the filming of this thing.

Yes, I love Linkin Park. Yes, their  Hybrid Theory  was one of my favorite albums (however, i haven't listened to the new one really at all). Yes, they're one of my favorite bands... but no, i don't think they're one of the best bands of all time. I just like them. I don't know why, but I do.   Tonight Iann will be my date for a long, long, long night of whoa.

There were only nine of us...he gave each of us a piece of dry wall and a glomp of spakel (sp?) and we drew with the spakel stuff. It was fun.  In gym we played basketball and soccer. It was loads of fun but only because Sarah's class was allowed to come over into Team Sports. How come I made it into Team Sports but Sarah didn't? She signed up for it and all. Whatever. Hmmm....  Government sucked arse today. I'm not even joking either. Out of six classes, only one person got an A on his Final. Only five people got Bs or Cs. Yeah, that means that 90% of us got Ds and Es. And I was one of them! I got a D! I was upset, I wanted at least a C because I have an A in the class. So I wanted a C or higher on the test because I would at least get a B in the class then, but now, how does that D on the test weigh out my A? I was upset but honestly I wasn't that surprised.  In English we talked about sonnets again. We read the famous Sonnet 18, ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"" Then we read a sonnet about a gay love slave...Shakespeare was a strange, strange man, even though he was brilliant. I got to talk to Amanda and Coooory.  Finally tomorrow I get to go to A-day. I have theatre arts and Spanish, but that's all I'm looking forward to. Nick and Cory are in my Algebra class, so that's good, but there are some not-so-good people in that class too. People who hate me, and I hate them, so we're all one big happy hate-fest. I don't even know why we hate each other. Some people are just really prissy and bitchy sometimes. Anyway, at least Amanda said she was in that class, and hopefully Andy, Brad, Ryan, and Jenny will be in there too because I haven't seen them lately.   Tomorrow is the last Indoor meet! Whoop! I'm running the two-mile. It's at the armory though, and I haven't run there yet. Full of army dudes, and I'm a navy brat. Teehee. Lalalalala.

105,,"I had a pretty normal week, a few cool things, but  I thought I'd review it to shed a little insight on a dmh week.  DMH Week in review. Starting with: Thursday, March 18 - I was a sub for a P.E. teacher at Hillview middle school.  I worked with Tisa.  It was picture day for the jr highers.  all i did all day was read the newspaper.  After school I read some bible, then I wrote a few pages on my 'bigfoot' script in the writing room at the Bayou, then I skipped my weekly bowling night because Brent invited me to go down to L.A. to see Barry Cavin's (ex- biola theater prof) new play 'fetish.'  friday,  March 19 - I was back at hillview m.s. in a class that I've subbed for before.  It was 8th grade language arts and social studies.  the class watched an Anne Frank video (babe!) and I surfed the internet all day.  Then I went home, read some bible, and wrote on the script for a while.  at night Billy, Dan, Frank and I saw ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in Long Beach.  We got some brews at E.J. Malloy's afterwards.  I didn't spend the night in Long Beach though, which is a departure from my normal weekly activities (i'll do it tonight :) )     saturday, March 20 - Went with Frank down to a protest march down in Hollywood.    It was protesting American military occupation overseas.  I don't like the amount of US involvment overseas, but I went mostly to see the show.  It was incredible!  Thousands of people going crazy.  Signs, chanting, drums, shouting, preformance art, anarchists, democrats, socialists, homosexuals, palestinians, koreans, me, frank, a hummer made out of cardboard, excellent.  I loved it.  I met a hot muslim babe too.  Frank got all up in her game though.  Frank introduced my to the famous LA street hot dog.  It rocked.  a hot dog wrapped in bacon bought from a street cart.  yum!  Then i went home , read some bible, and wrote the rest of the night i think.  sunday - march 21 - went to church (grace brethren of long beach). i talked matt maust and nate warkentin too long though and missed the adult bible fellowship i go too afterward.  ate lunch with matt miller, frank, Bryan mazarello and hsi wife down on at pauls place 2nd st in L.B. i had a savory gyro.  we walked around belmont shores and I went home, wrote a little and then went to Matt bethancourt's engagment party  monday, march 22 - kindergarden at Ceres elementary.  It was exhausting.  oh, but i had a huge lunch break on which for some reason i went to stater brothers and bought 10 cans of wolfgang puck soup. I'm pretty sure all i did that day was read the bible then write on the script (seriously, exciting life, huh?).  tuesday march 23 -  1st grade at scott avenue.  I liked this class.  They were a bunch of huggers.  cute kids.  We learned about the number 10.  He hopped 10 times.  counted 10 shamrock and 10 stars, and colored 10 flowers and I drank 10 cups of coffee (well, almost.  I've really been pounding the coffee lately.).  After school, Jesse was back from hawaii so we ordered a little caeser, talked about our scripts and watched 'modern times' a charlie chaplin flick.  I don't think i wrote too much this day.  i chilled on the porch at the Bayou (matt, andy and jesse's place), then went home and bibled it up.  wednesday march 24 - i had a half day at oceanview, one of my favorite schools, the day started at 11:30a.m, so i slept in (yea!), made some coffee and bibled it. until work.  Dude, what did I do wednesday? oh yeah.  I wrote a little after school, started reading ""for whom the bell tolls"" by hemmingway,  then Dan, Billy and I went to a Long Beach state baseball game.  Jared Weaver, one of the top pitchers in the nation, was throwing.  it was cool, but the best part was this 'mascot' at the game named Joe.  He was hilarious.  I didn't really understand the whole thing though.  He wore a LB State jersey that said ""joe"" on the back and walked around carrying a laminated picture of a woman from the JC penny catalog.  he made fuuny faces and noises at people and was mentally hadicapped.  seriously.  between innings, he was ""elvis joe"" and put on a wig and danced and sang and played guitar.  i don't know, dude.  afterwards Andy met up with us and we had some pints a EJ Malloy's  thursday march 25 - for some reason I was in a serious funk yesterday.  I was down in the dumps, like really depressed.  I was back at oceanview.  The day went ok, but I got a huge headache, went home laid on the couch.  I didn't feel like writing, reading Hem or the bible, or watching a movie, or taking a nap.  I was in limbo and it sucked and i had a headache.  Ever feel like that.  it wasn't that I didn't have motivation, but everything that i would normal do appeared repulsive to me.  I wanted to run away.  I was depressed about writing, about relationships (or lack of femaleness), my own spiritual state before God, everything.  I hiked up taranutula hill, which is a few blocks from my place.  form there you can see the ocean, LA, Long beach, orange county, catalina island, most of the Southland really.  its one of my favorite spots.  I like trying to figure out where things are like a really life Rand mcNally in front of me.  I watched the sun go down and the lights come out.  the sky was beautiful.  baby blue, and purple and orange and black with all the greater la lights too.  It was great.  I still had a headache though and was still serverly depressed.  i wanted to drop out of society.  Then i began to remember memory verses I had learned on Teen Mission Int'l went i went to Ukraine and Thailand and Belieze.  I started saying them out loud.  verses like matt 10:28-30 and jer. 33:3 and phil 4:13 and Romans 8:18, 28, and 38-39, Acts 1:8, john 3:16,  Dude, it was like i could remember them all.  i had a huge peace.  afterward I went to hear matt miller read some poetry and then we all hit up bowling night in LBC with billy and dan.  friday, march 26  today is great.  i skipped work.  and got up at 11:30.  i'm doing the read through the bible in a year and i read in deuteronomy.  it's rough man.  repitition.  but i'm getting through it.   Then i hit up ""For Whom.."" I was listening to jazz while i was reading, then it hit me.  There's this cd, by Christopher o'brien.  it's solo piano of Radiohead songs.  I really wanted that cd right then.  I just had an urge.  it was like the munchies..  so i went up and put my laundry in at the MAT and bought the cd uptown at loevels.  it is incredible.  earlier i talked about how radiohead puts me in the trance like state.  well, i'm listing to it on my disc man.  i go back to the laundrymat and put my clothes in the dryer.  i sat there listening to my cd watching my clothes spin for about 10 minutes.  it was hypnotic.  i was in trance or something, but is the most peaceful I've felt in a long time.  i recomend doing it some time.  i just watched the dryer.  ""oh theres my tigers shirt, there's my cat in the hat boxers, there my towel, theres my red boxer briefs, there's my paisley shirt...""  i loved it.  i wish i would have stayed all afternoon.  then i ate at this new cafe in Uptown whitter 'crepes and grape""  i had a chickem, roma tomato, feta cheese, mushroom, whole wheat crepe with an espresso.  i dreamt i was in europe.  it was so savory.  it was the most satisfied i've been my a meel in a long time.  today has been incredible"

116,,"Okay, here we go- a couple friends of mine started a clan for Counter-Strike called Team PDA(public displays of assination(you may roll your eyes now)). I've been watching them argue and scuffle about making a website, getting servers they don't need, and who is in the clan or not.  And in the midst of all this, they decide that the most important thing for them to do at this juncture is change their name to Digital Adrenaline(you may shoot yourself now). Can you get any more generic? I bet there are at least 2 other clans out there named that.  I refuse to join a clan, even if they asked me to.   [edit: I would start one, but i would never join an existing one]  Why? Because I, unlike many gamers these days, play games to have FUN. When you join a clan, you join a world of schedules, rules, and expectations. It's no FUN. I could have sworn that GAME developers developed GAMES, not serious sports.  Here's what would make me like clans- since it's just a game, and if they lose, they act like their life is over. My idea is, give them something they really need to worry about. Have it where, if your clan loses, you get shot in the knee. See? Problem solved. I'm happy because idiots are getting shot in the knee, and the clans have actually something to worry about! Drinks all round!  But of course, sport-gamers are stupid, they would never listen to reason.   I heard an arguement about Battlefield 1942 by a friend of mine, he said ""Man, that game's no fun, all you do is mess around."" and my rebuttle was ""...isn't that the point?""  When I play a game, i'm sick of realism. I want to have my expectations of what's possible blown right out of the sky. Everybody wants me to play America's Army(a painfully realistic simulation, i don't even call it a game), which is no fun at all because you have to complete training (some of which consists of getting the entire fucking vietkong thrown at you and 3 seconds to kill them all, with having a 12 second fucking reload animation) before you can even get to play with your friends. It's stupid shit, i'm gonna go play TRON 2.0 some more.  That one was good. It took everything Tom Clancy and the folks who came up with the rules of football said, and kicked them out on their asses. TRON 2.0 = TRON + badass + totally kicking the ass of my perception of what's possible(!!) + Rebecca Romijn.  The levels never got boring (Halo, Enter the Matrix), the combat never got monotonous(Serious Sam, Serious Sam, Serious FUCKING Sam), and the multiplayer doesn't lag like a whore on most occasions.

""successful people are the ones that have no free time, but give themselves time for everything""... he he he...   The new project I am into is called  urlLink IXP , is a company that provides internet services (ISP), e-commerce and an increasing number of services... and I am starting to make some good money out of it... in dollars!... :-) yay!... (if anyone clicks there, and is interested write me an email, I can give you all the details, and if you are interested we can make things happen for you too).  Still making webpages and flash stuff to get some cash, and working on comics harder everytime... karaokulta is experiencing a couple of problems, people related, which is good, because companies grow from those. One of the issues with creative teams is that, after all, everybody has a very different ""take"" on the final product, and we all have to learn to be flexible and accept someone else's work... anyway, I know it will work out.  Aswell working a lot in several things... helping that shelter with sick children... and having some great talks with a couple of friends... Every day I realize how powerfull we all are, and how we tend to use that power against ourselves... if we could all believe in what we dream of... we'd be living a whole different kind of life.  **Anyway cheers!... I miss you blog... he he he... but keep in mind that I do think of you often...  bye there."
123,,"Humanity: the Toolmakers, or just Tools? (or: on being 24 and some monthsâ¦)    Iâm 24 and loving it.  I get to sleep late, be bothered by friends and family that I donât have a job (Iâm looking, kidsâ¦ trust me, Iâm looking.), watch cartoons in my underpants, and write my thoughts for the whole web to see.  Iâm trying my best not to be depressed about getting older, because Iâm really not that old.  Although, for all our crazy amounts of advancement, it seems that our developmental stage is increasing a great deal.  When my parents were my age, theyâd been married for three years.  And when their parents were my age, THEYâD been married for more like five or six.    This is not to say that Marriage is the âgateway to adulthood,â but itâs a serviceable litmus for judging how responsible and in the real world a person is.  In the age of my grandparents, a high school education could feed a family.  For my parents, a bachelorâs degree most certainly sufficed.  Now, all my friends are taking Grad school courses, getting more and more advanced degrees, and hiding in the ivory tower well into their middle 20s.  Pretty soon Doctorates will be run of the mill, and people wonât be beginning their intended careers until theyâre into their 30s.    	Is this a result of a longer life expectancy?  People are alive and kicking and active well into their 80s nowadays.  My Grandmother is full of pizzazz, and even remarrying (and donât think for a minute Iâm not a bit disturbed that sweet little gramma is getting more action than me nowadays).  Because life is longer, childhood follows suit.  Bunches of my friends still live with mom and dad (not that thereâs anything wrong with that, wink wink).  It seems acceptable to return to the nest to save up some cash and plan the next step.  Maybe this âgoing homeâ tendency is the reason for the prolonging of childhood.  And parents are of course not averse to this, because theyâre watching their kids grow up faster than an eldritch DJ spins up âCatâs in the Cradleâ at the social club mixer.  Maybe this is a good thingâ¦ maybe itâs keeping us young at heart.  But it remains a fact that folk are less willing to take on the responsibility that their folks and grandfolks took up at a much younger age.     	Thereâs another angle to this phenomenonâ¦ and itâs the reason I started this article.  I was sort of typing and filling space until I found the connection, and then BAM!  There it is.  Weâre living longer, and also staying younger longer BECAUSE our forefathers had done things to promote a newer, shinier reality.  We are growing older more slowly because we have the benefit of their mistakes.    We have a history.   Iâve seen 2001: a space odyssey many times, and I love the whole movie, but one of the most interesting parts is in the beginning, with all the crazy monkeys.  Theyâre monkeying around, drinking water and being generally simian, when the monolith descends and sort of speeds up their evolution.  And the one monkey (I think his name was moonwatcher in the book, but donât quote me)  is playing with the predatorâs bone one hot desert day and comes to the realization that he can use it to bonk other creatures on the head.    A lot of people think (and I donât necessarily disagree) that Monkeyface realizes he can use things as tools, and this is what makes him powerful enough to overcome the jaguar and the enemy tribe of monkeys, and eventually overcome the barriers of the earth itself.  We humans are hailed as the great toolmakers; we possess gadgets and objects of infinite intricacy and usefulness.  And we have the opposable thumbs to use them.  I love using them, myself, Iâm looking at my shiny (though not much more useful than a piece of paper) Palmtop Computerâ¦ a cigarette lighter (fire is officially our bitchâ¦ take that, animal kingdom!)  plastic bottles, even the computer Iâm using now.    But I think the fact that we are toolmakers is only a part of the equation.  All sorts of animals use tools.  Chimps use sticks to root out anthills, scratch their backs, et cetera.  Even without the opposable thumb we wave in front of them derisively, they still can make use of things not of their bodies.    So is it communication?  We have a wonderful language that allows us to convey things, like telling a fellow that a potted plant is about to fall on their head, or that you would like a hot dog with Cappyâs sauce upon it.    But thatâs not it eitherâ¦ animals communicate too, at least on some level.   Birdâs mating callsâ¦ gorilla gestures, screeching warnings.  And perhaps more useful than even our language is the hive mind, allowing flocks of birds to intuitively move as one while migrating, silently striding packs of wolves hunting, ants almost instantly knowing where food isâ¦ the ability to work as a unit makes for a great deal of efficiency (At the cost of individuality, which is why cellphones and Instant Messenger scare me, but thatâs another post altogether)  Neither toolmaking nor communication is manâs secret weapon, and although weâre damn good at it, weâre not the only game in town.  Youâd think that animals, communicating and using tools for so many eons, would eventually get better at it, but they donât.    Besides, tools and communication fail.  Weâre at the mercy of our dayplanners.  Things that should be making us more time in fact give us less free time.  Hunters and gatherers had all day to look around and dream, once the berries and carcasses were all in the nomadic village.  It is this dreaming that really started the whole thing.  Tools seem almost counterintuitive; are we using the tools, or are the tools using us?  Communication, for all its flowery eloquence, also fails us.  Thereâs no real way of being sure that what we convey is that which is understood by those who receive.  Feelings might be universal, but for all we know, all perception is unique.  You and I do not feel the same anger, the same love, the same sadness, we donât see the same car, the same hot blonde, the same color red.  For all of our wonderful words and objects, we remain, by and large, island universes.  We have nothing except a collectively shared, yet individually experienced, past.  History is what the beasts do not have.  They have instinct (which is badass, but thereâs not much choice in it) but itâs way too slow.  An animal will be killed at the hands of men for generations upon generations before they get it into their heads that the bipeds are not to be trusted.  The life, and experience of an animal ends with that animal.  It passes on its genes, makes a baby wolf, and the instinct and the cycle continue.  Wolves canât sit around the forest grove, fondly remembering Grandpa One Eye, reminiscing about how he once outsmarted the bobcat that one time, and wasnât it funny as hell?    The scene in 2001 is less about a single monkey learning how to use a bone as a weapon, and more about that monkey coming to the realization that his actions, and the actions of his brothers, can have a lasting effect on the world.    History is communication to the nth degree.  Our past is what allows us to grow older and stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and make improvements on their innovations.  It allows us to observe both personal and collective progress within our lifetimes.  It gives us a bar which is silently begging to be jumped over and raised.  Our communications and our tools are only symptoms of our understanding of what has come before.  Our past has given us a future.  But when you really get down to it, our history is flawed.  Itâs written by the victors, so sayeth Napoleon, and many stories and innovations are lost.  Misinformation and propaganda paint unreal pictures of the way things are.  Violent crime in this country decreases, and yet the mediaâs reporting of violent crime increases exponentially.  The powers that be understand the power of history, and use it to control reality.  We begin to see that what weâre taught about our past isnât a really accurate picture.  The present becomes the past all too quickly these days.  Americans have short memoriesâ¦ I can remember the vigils held on October 11th, 2001, the vows to never forget the attack upon our nation.  I remember the moment of silence on the radio on September 11th, 2002.  But this past year?  I donât remember a single thing, save some idle chatter on msnbc.  Itâs being pulled out again for the sake of election campaigns, but it will once again fade into obscurity, adorning the pages of history books as a footnote for the beginning of the 21st century.    History is our salvation, our opiate, and ultimately, our crutch and our untimely demise.  More and more information is out there these days, thanks to the internetâ¦ but the net is in a state of constant flux.  Websites change, but there is no record of what came before it.  Itâs going too fast.  Instinct has the benefit and disadvantage of being slow, it seems.  It takes its time and makes DAMN sure that the information is good and correct.  It does so at the cost of individual members in the species.  If our information age were to fail, what then?  Tribes of barbarians, sweeping through the streets of cities, destroying history. It would be the fall of Rome, all over again.  The Dark ages.  A time to gather together in the hollow shells of our technology, and try to piece together what we lost. We donât have the benefit of a rich oral tradition, save a collective memorization of the Adam Sandler âHanukkah Songâ.  We couldnât teach our children much more than survival.  If a dark age were to come upon us right now, our wonderful and terrible tools would rust, unused, unknown.  150 years from now, buckskin clad great grandchildren would be drying hides on the interstates, smashing open skulls with back massagers. Needless to say, it would be a considerable setback.  So I was wrongâ¦ history isnât the answer.  Now, bear with me.  Perhaps at the moment of cogitation, a new kind of organism was born: the Idea. Itâs a simpler sort of historyâ¦ and maybe history itself is an idea.  But think about how ideas work.  Passed from person to person, constantly mutating, spreading, dying out.  It sounds almost like a virus.  Maybe it isâ¦ a sort of electrical impulse virus soaring through words and feelings. Perhaps instinct is the evolutionary forefather of the idea, passed genetically, slowly...   Sprouting forth from instinct, Our brains were fertile grounds for the Ideas.  The mental capacity grew, and so grew innovation.  Designated as the vessels of ideas, we watch some of them grow, while some die on the vine.  Like the Gods we thought they were, Ideas have only to be forgotten to be killed. Stronger ideas seem to spread like wildfire, and sometimes two ideas that contradict have themselves a little conflict.  Holy wars, Inquisitions, Crusades.  And all the rest.  So are we at the whim of our ideologies?  Is it like some Douglas Adams novel, where lab mice are in control, and we are made to believe the opposite?  Are we the warships and Bentleys of a bunch of neurological impulses?  Are we just material side effects?  The fleshy housing of the abstract?  This seems to be a dismal way of looking at ourselves.  I like to think we ARE our abstractions, and we're sometimes caught up in the tangibility of it all.  Reality, expression, all of it is just a set of corporeal training wheels, itching to be taken off by some cosmic socket wrench.  We may someday transcend into pure energyâ¦ because after all, matter is simply energy that is trapped.  I look forward to the day when my great great Grandchildren (or grandnephews, Iâm not counting that particular chicken until sheâs in my bed) will shake off these obsolete earthly bindings, and float seamlessly into the Aether.  Maybe it will happen within my lifetime.  Innovation is happening more and more quicklyâ¦ Following the Ideas up to the present, Agriculture to Smithing, to Industry, to computers, to god knows whatâs been invented this weekâ¦ thereâs exponentially less time between leaps, and the distance each leap covers is growing exponentially the other way.  So in time, there will be a critical juncture, as these equations we call life reach their asymptotes, and everything will start happening very quickly.  So donât get caught with your pants down.  To quote an enlightened being who was trying to eliminate all the needless law and rhetoric (again, another post altogether), âRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,â or somesuchâ¦ all I know is, itâs going to be a hell of a ride.  Our childhoods are lengthening because we need to have the limber minds of the young in order to transcend.  All this advancement, all this history, all these conversations could be preparing us for something amazing.  Maybe we need to cast off the tools and speeches and knowledge that has brought us this far, like booster rockets falling off of a space shuttle, hurtling towards the inky depths of space, expanding infinitely, and becoming what we were meant to be.   whether we like it or not, whether we KNOW about it or notâ¦  we are, all of us, constantly becoming.  Hereâs to 24.      --The Slater"

131,,"When you hear a kind word spoken about a friend, tell him so.  Never hesitate to do what you know is right.  Don't work for recognition, but do work worthy of recognition.  Remember that a kind word goes a long way.  Take some silly photos of yourself & a friend in an instant photo booth.  Earn your success based on service to others, not at the expense of others.  Spend twice as much time praising as you do criticizing.  Seek respect rather than popularity.  Never forget that it takes only one person, or one idea, to change your life forever.  When you need a little advice, call your grandparents.  Teach your son as well as your daughters to cook.  Shoot a few hoops.  Never ignore an old barking dog.  Never criticize your country when travelling abroad.  Keep a pad & pencil by every phone.  Never let the odds keep you from persuing what you know in your heart you were meant to do.

132,,"Reading Stranger in a Strange Land for a second take, I find myself far less sympathetic to the story, the characters and the ideas than I was to Starship Troopers, which is odd, because ST is obviously a book far less in line with my own views. However, I had to respect ST for being a reasonable attempt to portray a particular ideology. And I guess I should give this book the same benefit, but stating that 9 out of 10 rapes are partly the woman's fault,and then placing that statement in a female character's mouth is such a low blow. A writer has godlike powers over his imaginary worlds - and Heinlein is just misusing these powers in an instance like this. Heinlein seems posessed of a particularly nasty chauvanism - he constantly creates women who are incredibly capable and tough, but then spoils everything by making them nyphomaniacs who wait hand and foot on the menfolk. What he admires in these women, I feel, is not that they know so much or are so capable, but that, despite all that, they still 'give'.   Of course I'm open to being contradicted and refuted, in detail preferably, on these perceptions."

138,,"urlLink ENFP under stress  ENFP  ENFPs have a tendency to overextend themselves in both their physical and emotional commitments. Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances. ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started. Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict. During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated. They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves.  The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances. These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress. Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances. They will be ""besides themselves"" and ""just not all there""  as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are. Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor. If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears."

141,,"Two cents  Derrick gave me access to his blog several weeks ago, but I haven't felt the need to comment much...but I thought I'd put in my two cents worth as his partner. Call me weird, but I can't help but hope someone is helped by Justin's story...  He is a man of contradictions, it is true, and he's done things that no one should ever be proud of (as have, if we were to be fully truthful with ourselves, all human beings). But I wanted to put my two cents in and tell you how  I  see him.  I don't think anyone who is comfortable with admitting it can deny that he is one of the cutest young guys you'll ever see. (Mind you, I am biased, but plenty of people agree with me.) He is a sweet, simple guy with an almost childish, teasing manner, and he can't help but flirt! His smile is genuine, and his face is expressive. His eyes are the best part--they twinkle in impish delight, harden in anger, widen in surprise or panic, and smoulder with passion.  He is a very bright person, but he hides his knowledge of literature and the world--or maybe tones it down so as not to alienate others. He can think with the best, but keeps his opinions to himself. He is empathetic, and is street smart in very odd and sometimes profound ways.  Derrick is very wounded, and has difficulty forgiving himself for actual and imagined crimes against humanity. He can be manipulative and narcissistic. He loves others deeply, and yet cannot really bring himself to believe that anyone would find him lovable. He exudes both innocence and experienced sexuality, but sometimes this becomes a problem when the ghosts from his past haunt him.  His experiences have given him, in many ways, a soft heart. I have to say, I am very proud of him for how far he's come, and how much his responses to tricky situations have changed. I believe he underestimates his own healing and how much potential he has. He believes he'll do great things in the world, and so bites off more than he can chew, convinced he can make a real difference; and yet, he is so fragile, prone to despair at the odds that are placed against him.  My own relationship with him has been rocky, in part because of restrictions placed on him by the justice system of the province. I can only pray that both of us will continuously renew our patience and loyalty, doing the best we can to move forward as individuals so that when there is freedom to do so, we can come fully back together.  I wanted to comment, lastly, that my partner loves Jesus Christ, although this is not reflected explicitly in his writings as of yet. He is an accepted child and forgiven son of the Most High God. Some people, reading his biography, may decide in their hearts that Derrick is irredeemable and sick, and what am I doing in his life? But the hope of the Good News that Jesus Christ brought from the Father is that he cares about the ones who are so broken that society wrings its hands in anger or despair, the ones who have been abused and the ones who have been abusers, the ones who have been theives and swindlers and addicts. Jesus Christ lifts those kinds of people out of muck and remakes them as Children and Heirs of the promises of God. This is the man that Derrick is becoming, slowly and painfully true, but I think I'll have fun watching him become himself, and then give the grace in his heart away to others who are just like he was.

I can not drink coffee, the food I used to eat does not taste good any more. I hate being here by myself. So much is now wrong with my life. The biggest and best part of me is missing and that is you. It is the other things that bothers me the most. I used to not be able to function or even start my day without my coffee. I had one cup of coffee tonight at work. I made a fresh pot and it did not taste good to me. I do not know what has happened to me since being with you in the Philippines? All I am left with is questions and no answers. The only thing that is right with me is that I am not depressed. That one puzzles me also. I wish I could find some answers to all of my questions? I do not know where to look for the answers. The only answer that makes any sense to me is being with you, and I do not mean over here with you either. I do not care if it would be Hong Kong, the Philippines anywhere over there would be perfect for me. I think the change would do me great. I know that I enjoyed the food, the weather and last but not least the company. Being with you just felt so right. I am going to go for now my love. I Love You So Much Lei Forever & Always Love Kevin"

147,,"Can you remember the best or worst day of your life? Is it the same day? There is a single day of my childhood that stands out among the memories. I recall these events with great anxiety and fear, as well as great joy and relief. This day was among the best, and the worst. The day started out like most others. Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. 	As a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. 	The routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasnât going to open it. She just shook her head and said, âNoâ.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. 	We started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldnât match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friendsâ mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friendsâ mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified. In my minds eye, I could see my mothersâ belt, affectionately known as âWhite Lightningâ, just lying there, waiting to dispense punishment. My friendsâ mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasnât mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didnât believe it. 	That day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest. It was an emotional roller coaster that stands out among my thousands of experiences and will remain with me forever."

What I liked about the conference was that he pretty much set you up as a youth ministry to take his content and go deeper with your kids.  What I didn't like is that our particular leader team didn't take advantage of it.  But that's the overall story a lot of times.  We take kids to these big events, but never go deeper.  Speakers give us almost everything we need to strike up conversations with them... We just don't take advantage of it....

167,,"Wednesday was (elder sister) Lianna's birthday. I was to go her party, which turned out to be more of a day out, in fact. She woke me up phoning, went to meet her at Argyle Street, having done without a breakfast and having only just gotten out of bed. Straight away I'm taken to a pub. It was a different pub for each point and I was enjoying myself, but somewhat overestimated my capacity for alcohol, especially when tired and on an empty stomach.   So, before long I was quite fucked and had to go back to Lianna's flat to rest for a while. Leaving my jacket in the pub I was in (I hope...otherwise fuck knows where it is), I was sent in a taxi with a makeshift map drawn up by Lianna's flatmate. I ended up harrassing these two nice girls (ladies), who pointed me in the basic direction whilst pissing themselves at the state of me on this fine afternoon. After some trouble with locks I eventually made it inside and crashed on the couch. I don't know if by crashed I mean slept or not...but when I came to my senses I had the telly on and it was announced: ""next up, Graham Norton""...my concept of time must have been fucked up for a while, must have just glazed over for a few hours.  Lianna's flatmate returned to take me back out again. It turned out I was being taken to a gay and lesbian bar, as that's where Lianna had went with her workmates. It was karoke night and...oh the campness of it all. the entertainer guy whose job it is to get a bit of banter going with the crowd singled me out as a straight person...not sure if the rest of the regulars then looked upon with contempt.

170,,"Over the past three days, I watched the following movies. Here are my reviews of the movies.    urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   I guess I need not give a gist of the story. The movie warrants a detailed post. I'll put it later.    urlLink  The Hunted   In the green woods of Silver Falls, Oregon, Aaron Hallam, a trained assassin AWOL from the Special Forces, keeps his own brand of wildlife vigil. After brutally slaying four deer hunters in the area, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement, he's closed off to his past, the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slayings are the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And, even as they go into their final combat against each other, neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter.   My comments :  It was wonderful. Can watch it more than once. This movie reminds me of David Morrell's works. It was ironic, reading a novel and watching a movie that were so similar.     urlLink  Confidence  : A con man gets into big trouble when unknowingly tries to scam an accountant that works for a mafia kingpin. Now, he has to pull off yet another scam to pay the mafia off before they get tired and decide to ""collect their losses."" Confidence is one of those heist films with plenty of twists, a lot of characters who are guaranteed to back stab at least once and flashy direction to put everything together. It is quite clear that by the end of the movie.   My comments :  It was interesting, humorous and twisting. Can watch it once or twice (if you like the dialogues).     urlLink  The Identity  :  Caught in a savage rainstorm, ten travelers are forced to seek refuge at a strange desert motel. They soon realize they've found anything but shelter. There is a killer among them and, one by one, they are murdered. As the storm rages on and the dead begin to outnumber the living, one thing becomes clear: Each of them was drawn to the motel, not by accident or circumstance, but by forces beyond imagination, forces that promise anyone who survives a mind-bending and terrifying destiny...   My comments :  It was a nice thrilling horror movie. Can watch it once.     Ennaku 20 Unnakku 18 : I guess this film does not need any story line.    My comments :  Yet another copy of Serendipity. The only best thing about the movie was the music. There were mistakes galore in the movie as expected from a Tamil film.     Janasheen : The newspapers seemd to say the movie was good. So this was my first Hindi movie for quite sometime. I don't know what the title means. Maybe someone can elucidate on it.    My comments :  It was a typical Hindi masala film. The usual baddies, songs in foreign locations, fights ad romances and infuriating makeup and dresses. THe one thing I liked in the movie was the bike race. It was filmed beautifully. I don't know if it was an archived footage or it was shot for the movie."

173,,"Stop this bus, I want to get on - 12/23/03   My commute to work every day takes me through a residential neighborhood, a classic New England street near a lake frozen over and still in the December air. This is an organic block, with the houses facing willy-nilly and in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Two story colonials, one-story starter houses, made of wood and brick and Bob Vila-approved vinyl siding, some with garages and some with sheds, some with broken-down cars littering their gravel stone driveways. This isnât one of those pre-fab neighborhoods, where all the houses look the same and every yard has the same single sapling planted in the strategic spot in their barely-there front yard, just enough in front to raise the property value but far enough to the right to keep the view from the bay window free. Nope. These houses were built individually, by different contractors and different architects, and each has their own unique and endearing character.    Normally, I manage to get my lazy ass out of bed before 7 AM, which gets me on the way to work well before the school buses start picking up kids. Last week, however, I slept in, and on my mad dash in to work I found myself stuck behind one of those lumbering yellow monstrosities as it worked its way through rural Farmington picking up students.  Now I consider myself a patient man, and only give in to road rage when it is completely justified (people cutting you off, failing to observe signs and traffic signals, police that feel the need to tailgate you in the left hand lane without their flashers on, those bastards). But I was two seconds from going nuclear once I realized that this bus was stopping at every other house to make pickups. Every other house. The road I was on was a half mile in length, at most. The furthest any of these kids would have had to walk to get to a hypothetical bus stop was a quarter mile. Whatâs that, a five-minute walk? Nope, sorry, this bus was stopping at every single driveway for every single little brat kid.  I hate to sound like some stereotypical old man on this, but didnât we all have to walk our sorry butts through the snow and ice to our neighborhood bus stop when we were snot-nosed third graders? There was none of this front-door concierge service when I was growing up. There was one stop for every two to three block radius, and that was it. And as much as it sucked when it was snowing or raining, wasnât the bus stop a cool-ass place to hang out? All the neighborhood kids together without parental supervision, with just enough time before the bus came to raise some quality childhood hell.   This certainly wasnât the case this fateful morning. Traffic was backed up all the way up and down the street because of the front door service the bus was offering. It amazed me what a wasteful system this was, not only for the traffic and the time involved, but for the parents who were stuck watching their kids at each stop. Why not have one stop, like we used to do, and have one parent each day rotate in to watch the little brats? Instead, each parent had to wait for their kid to be picked up every day before they could get back to their daily routine, whether it be go to work, clean up house, sleep with the milkman, etc. All the cars stalled, all the parents interrupted, and the bus taking close to an hour to finish its route. Things looked about as efficient as a Soviet supermarket.  It seems like our society is getting into trouble with our antiseptic lifestyle choices. The bus stop saga is just a metaphor for how disconnected weâve all become from each other. I guarantee you the reason why the bus had to stop at each house was because the neighbors didnât know each other well enough to trust them with their kids. Rather than take the time and effort to get to know each other, to develop the strong bonds of community that allow cooperation to occur, weâd rather petition the school district to pick up everyone right at their door. Never mind the dangers that might befall our kids as they walk three houses down to the communal bus stop. What kind of world do we live in when you canât feel safe letting your kid walk around your own neighborhood?  That sounds like a paranoid statement to make, doesnât it? Thatâs the way our society works nowadays. People are paranoid and skeptical for absolutely no reason. I guarantee you that the neighborhood I was driving in that day hadnât seen a violent crime committed in decades. The problem is, peopleâs perceptions are defined more by the 10 oâclock news than their own experiences. Why not extend a friendly invitation to the neighborhood, get to know everyone and confirm for yourself that the surroundings are friendly? No such luck, I suppose.   Add on top of this our fanatical obsession with safety and cleanliness. God forbid our sons and daughters trip on their way to the bus stop and skin their knees, right? Weâre raising our offspring in plastic bubbles, where theyâre force fed bottled water, made to breathe purified air, forced to swim in chlorinated pools and made to clean themselves with abrasive chemicals and nonspecific antibiotics. From birth weâre forcing them to live on crutches made of HEPA filters and amoxicillin, and theyâre no better for it. Incidences of asthma and life-threatening allergies are on the rise in the United States, and many scientists believe that this is directly related to the way we are raising our children. Granted, most parents assume that they are doing whatâs right for their children, but since when do you have to pass an aptitude test to become a parent?   Weâre stuck with a nation of shrink-wrapped, sanitized children with their umbilical cords still attached, forcing the system to work for each individual while eschewing the community at large. Unfortunately, we have every right as American citizens to stick our middle finger up at the world and refuse to interact. But when everything from medicine to government to even the busses have to make that proverbial stop at every individual house, how can there ever be enough time to take care of everyoneâs needs?

176,,happy easter!  I hope all of you are rockin' with your families and stuff.  Since Leah and I don't have any family around here...we'll hang out with good frieinds instead.   I've had the past few days off so we've been the laziest couple around.  Sleeping in till 9 everyday rules!!!  Just moping around So. Cal is great. It's not that we've seen it all...we're just sick of seeing any of it.   And the weather has been crummy lately too. ( for LA standards)   Leah tried to Hijack our NETFLIX last weekend while i was gone....which means she had a slew of 'chick' flicks rented....and they never got back to the warehouse this week...so we've been without good movies. (So i hijacked netflix and rented all guy movies!!)  Lets see....I'm pretty sick of So. Cal.   Any ideas?  OK....we love you all.....all of you who read this and know who we are. bye.
177,,"I'm pissed at my parents... On Monday my mom had told me to get to bed at 10:30, which I did. I couldn't sleep because I'm not used to trying to that early, and close to 11:45 I got up to get a drink. She arrived home, accused me of disobeying her (what the he... such a huge offence...) and then accused me of lying to her when I tried to convince her otherwise. Whatever... I just went back to bed and forgot about it, but then the next night she was out again, and sometime around 9:50 my dad was like, ""Why aren't you in bed?"" I just kinda  stared blankly at him and was like ""wha...?!?"" I learned that apparently as a punishment for not being in bed 'on time' on Monday I was supposed to go to be at the hideous time of 9:30 on Tuesday. My mom thought that my dad had told me and my dad had thought that my mom had. It gets even better though... My stupid stupid mom didn't care that it was infact my dad's fault, she decided to punish me for the 'offence'  again  on Wednesday by making me go to bed again at 9:30.  Now on Wed. I don't normally even get home untill past 6:30 and yesterday, my dad had to run a couple errands so I didn't get home untill past 7. I flat out told her that I wouldn't have enough time no matter how she sliced it and that I was not going to go to bed at 9:30. Oh, by the way, we're having a blood drive today at school and I signed up for it assuming my parents would be perfectly fine with it. I mentioned it to my dad, who didn't care, and again to my mom when I got home, right before I told her that I wasn't going to be able to get to bed on time. She mentioned that she had some concern about me being constantly fatigued and that it might make it worse if I were to give blood, but then had to run out the door to catch a movie with some friends.  I called her sometime after 9:30 to address the concerns that she had because I was getting ready for bed, but she steered the conversation to why I wasn't already in bed, not some health issues she might have with me donating blood. I was really hurt by that because it says to me that she cares more about her rules that she impetuously lays down than for me, her son's health. We ended up in an argument which consisted of me almost pleading with her to hear me out, but finally after she cut me off the umpteenth time and said no, I hung up on her. I know, I know, that was a bad thing to do and I already appologized to her. Regaining my composure in a matter of seconds, I kept from crying and went upstairs to my dad's room and right as I knocked on his door, my mom called him. She started telling him her side of the story and before I could get a word in edge-wise, he started doing to her what she had just before been doing to me: abruptly steering the conversation to another topic and blaming it all on her. He started on his whole partyline about how she was a horrible wife and mother and she should be home helping us kids with homework and such (btw, she pours countless hours into doing stuff like that, he just never takes the time to think through his name-calling, yelling tantrums) Anyway, he ended up hanging up on her too, but for a much different reason than I did.   Now would be a good time to clarify that my family's disfunctional.   Anyway, this morning I talked to my mom for a good twenty minutes about the blood donation thing, and she still is stubbornly sticking to punishing me for something that I didn't do and then wasn't informed that I 'did' by not letting me help save a life. Brilliant mom, just brilliant."

He thinks that by virtue of the fact that he's running linux, he's automagically protected by the mighty hand of Torvalds, or something. Sheesh. Don't get me wrong, *nix is great, it ranks right up there with Netware, in terms of stability. So what's my point? It doesn't matter what OS you run, what matters is the fact that your OS is (1) Updated with any patches/fixes. (2) Running adequate antivirus software with current defs. (3) Behind a firewall. At least use NAT, people. C'mon. (4) Only install software from reputable firms. If you install KaZaa to steal music/video/software, then you deserve the ad/spy/malware! That's right, I said it.

Since I havenât debuted there yet, here are some (not just 5) of mine:   Things Iâm not afraid to admit, but probably should be:   I get to work an hour early so Iâm not in bad mood due to overcrowded trains.  Iâm usually pretty good about not eating sweets until right before my period at which point I will sit on the kitchen floor and eat left over chocolate icing right out of the can using my finger.  I still like to send handwritten letters to my family.  If I could, I would live in South Louisiana and I would be the happiest person in all the world.  My cat, Berg, thinks Iâm his mistress and tries to make a move on me from time to time.  I have a heater underneath my desk that is always on as long as Iâm at work.  And if Iâm really cold, I also use my heating pad which can also be found under my desk.  In nearly 3 years, Iâve only been to one small part of Central Park several times.  Iâve only been to 1 major league baseball game â the Mets & they lost.  The very first concert I went to was either Bad Company when they came to NSU in Natchitoches or Clint Black in Shreveport.  I used to watch professional wrestling religiously.  I ordered the pay-per-views every month, but I have since stopped watching.  Part of me is disappointed and the other part is relieved.     And now, get ready for the Thursday Threesome :   Onesome : Something Old â Do you have anything that youâve owned simply forever A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family . . . I have a wooden coffee table and an old metal kitchen table that was my (great)Grandmotherâs.  They have traveled with me everywhere!   Twosome : Something New â Buy anything lately?  I bought lunch today, does that count?  Otherwise, the last thing I purchased that wasnât food was a baby shower gift for someone I work with: diapers, wipes, baby spoons, medicine dropper, pacifiers, gas drops.   Threesome : Something Borrowed â Ever borrowed anything and never returned it?  I hate to admit it, but yes.  Some old tapes of ECW (wrestling) that someone loaned when I moved to NYC.   Bonus : Something Blue â See anything blue from where you are? What is it?  My shirt is blue, but other than that, my mousepad is also blue and the label on my water bottle and the cover of my notebook, the highlighter in my penholder, the top to my lotion bottle . . .

187,,"Zombie:  A being that behaves like us and may share our functional organization and even, perhaps, our neurophysiological makeup without conscious experiences  source*http://members.aol.com/lshauser/zomboid.html   1. The reason why zombies don't eat each other is simple. They are not cannibals, while it is commonly believed that they have some conciousness it is usually due to what we call in zombie circles ""residual memory"". This is the reason why in  urlLink Night of the Living Dead  and  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  Zombies returned to their homes and were drawn to people they knew. The process of zombie-fiction is akin to an eraser of conciousness which whittles someone's concious to the simply the some of their parts. This is why ""brain-eating"" is prevalent amongst zombies. Though all signs point to them being ""dead-ish"" there is that basic need to recapture that conciousness and to keep from from actually dying (becoming inanimate, with zero conciousness etc) Zombies are driven purely by biological instinct. Conciousness can only come from a fully concious human NOT another Zombie and THIS is why they don't eat each other.  2. In the Movie 28 days later, the zombie concioussness is distentegrated to one common denominator and that is pure and unadulterated RAGE. THESE zombies have inhabited the conciousness of the disease which they are infected with. The conciusness of a virus is like that of any other living creature and that instinct drives it to procreate, or in this case infect others. Now what isn't  believable in the movie 28 days later was how quickly this ""disease"" makes you ""turn"" or transform into zombie conciousness.  3. Zombie Movies, started by the great George A. Romero have always been political commentaries and satires. Because the zombie lacks conciousness, it is reduced to the role of a foil. It's a dramatic tool used to illuminate things about the main characters, those humans with conciusness with whom we the audience have a vested interest in. Because traditional zombies were slow, ghoulish, stupid, easy to kill, when the main characters died it was usually through some character flaw of their own or to illuminate something that Romero was trying to convey. In the original Night of the Living Dead, he was making a racial/moral commentary on Post-50's life in rural America and on our moral economy. In Dawn of the Dead he was discussion issues such as the morality of abortion, consumerism etc.  What makes a 28 days later a significant movie in the zombie genre is the fact that these zombies are rabid, they run : This means that blame shifts over to the zombie and not to you the concious human being.  Like Lord of the Flies, the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce  any questions?"
188,,"*bow* Congrats, finally. Well at least for now....yes, always, I am the addle-pated preacher.   Dudes, I fucking am so tired. I don't know what I'm still doing awake. I really don't want to sleep, is what...you know? I'm really tired and I think I'm going to die man, but it's just not in my card for me to go to bed yet.

And also buzzing with Chester and his performance of  A Place For My Head . Seriously, palpatations, convulsions, spasms, laughing at the top of my lungs for about three hours since. My chest snapped as it constricted with Chester's awesomeness.  And dudes, what better, they're coming next month. I'm going, I asked Abby (kind of afraid of the pit...this is  a  pit, man, a real damn pit), we should all go. Damn, that would be slick. We would seriously all join the pit and get our asses kicked and love it. POD (big woop), Hoobastank (eh) and Story of the Year (who?) are opening. Damnit, I am excited. I should have never taken that CD when my dad put it in my hands. It's just too damn much. I haven't been this excited over music since I acquired my first old Metallica and wrote my first halfway-plausible song. It's that heavy. I'm going to shut up now, maybe it's the tea.  I'm going to bed, I think. Please forgive whatever the hell I said here, not even I know. I was needing myself to type some of the caffeine away. Farewell til Sunday."

191,,"hehe - the funniest thing happened today to my little sister.  My aunt, uncle, and cousin were here from Georgia so we went with them to Santa Cruz to go to this marine laboratory that's just past Natural Bridges.  We were out on the cliff that over looks the ocean (its about 40 feet above the ocean) and my little sister is throwing and kicking rocks into the water below.  She kicks a rock and her shoe flies off her foot, landing 40 feet below in the ocean.  At first we could see the shoe but then a wave comes in and pushes the shoe even farther under the cliff and to add to that, its not possible to go down onto the beach.  Her shoe that she got about a month ago is now lost to the ocean.  Only her right foot too.  So we drove into Santa Cruz and bought her another pair of shoes.  It was hella funny.  She considered trying to climb down the cliff to get it and then the wave came.  So we bought her a pair of converse that are really cool.  They are blue high tops with light blue stitching and are light blue on the inside.  So she left for Santa Cruz with a pair of shoes and came back with three shoes.  We hassled her the rest of the time about losing her shoe. Poor poor little nikki!"
