493,,The remodeling is going very well as the buffet looks much better and the food has improved also. Our rooms were not ready at 6:00pm when we arrived to check in as the previous guests had not checked out as of yet but the front desk staff did a good job in getting us placed in rooms.
494,,A mushroom cloud of animal urine smell engulfed us as soon as we opened the door. We blasted the room with AC opened all the windows thinking that the smell will go away but it never did. Eventually all our clothes soaked up the smell and we stank ourselves! Calling/visiting the reception was of little use - staff on the night shift are not empowered to help and apparently no other room was available. We had no choice but to flee to the nearby Circus Circus. I believe mine is a rare case but I would never risk it again.
495,,My friend and I just got back from five days and four nights at the tropacana. We had a ball. The slots were loose help very friendly The entertainment was fantastic and everyone should go see the free air play that they perform six times a day. We received many comps and we had a problem with the hot water not turning off and called them at one in the morning and it was fixed within ten min. We will be going back there next year and staying at the tropacana.
496,,"What a horror story! We arrived at 11:30 pm in the pouring rain. Guess what? They did not inform us that their office closes at 11:00 on Wednesdays. We went to a neighbouring Budget Suites, they called the Security dept. and the lady on the phone said, &quot;Tell them to come back at 6 AM&quot; Did she want us to sleep on the street? After many phone calls by a friendly staff at the other Budget Suites up the road, we still had no response. Noone would give us the phone number of the property manager. Two hours later, we finally had an answer. Stay at the Budget Suites we were at, and the Wynn Budget Suites would reimburse our money in the morning. The Budget Suites we stayed at was clean, quiet and very friendly, and although five blocks closer to the strip, CHEAPER!! Never ever stay at the Wynn location. They do not give you all the information you need, but charge you for every thing you have...keys, linens, etc."
497,,"My husband and I have stayed here many times in previous years for just a few days.Each time we commented on the same things hoping for improvements. We don't like staying at the California Hotel anymore, it's gotten worse than before. It stinks really bad (smoky) and it comes through the vents and carpets. They offer to spray the room, but it only makes it worse. We had to leave the window (2 inches)open during our whole stay to keep it breathable. The hallways are the worst, the minute you step outside it has astrong moldy stinch. My husband got bitten on his feet by fleas either in bed or from the carpet. There were maybe 3 tissue papers in the dispenser, and no extra roll of toilet paper, although the half roll was neatly folded. It's time to move on, the cheap price was not worth the unhealthy quality of air in the casino, hallway and rooms. The air was so dry, my nose bled every morning, and our throat pinched and was raspy in the morning. My eyes were blood shot red, and gritty and my nose was running through out the two days. The old hotels don't have air filtering system, so it circulates the same stale air throughout the hotel. The size of the room was fine and the bathroom toilet was verynoisy to flush. The bedcover had brown spots on the side, (disgusting) and it wascovered over by a top sheet. I kid you not, a cheap rate is not worth having to go throughthese kind of experiences. This hotel is in bad need of a major cleaning, fumigation and installation of an air filtering system. Until then, we honestly cannot recommend. However, if you are a smoker and had a few drinks you may enjoy this place. The homeless walk around the premises, but they stay to themselves."
498,,"Beautiful Resort to stay in!! I really felt as if i was in CanCun, the pool is huge &amp; so nice, My room was almost the size of my house. I love the Comfortable bed, huge bathroom, very nicely decorated, calm/relaxing environment, &amp; excellent price. Absolutely loved it &amp; will definitly stay there again!!"
499,,"First you need a car...Clean , aged but clean and very friendly service people...Rooms are big (we had a suite), very quiet, lot's of amenities not far from the action...Nice ... to be recommended except if you want to gamble and party all night but for visiting Vegas at a very reasonnable price: The best."
500,,Casino Royale is now my place to stay in Vegas. I have been several times and did not even know they had rooms. All the rooms are remodeled. The dollar beers and margaritas help getting your day started. The gaming is not intimidating. Loved my stay there. A hidden gem. You can use the money you save to put on your favorite game.
501,,"I booked at Circus Circus because of the price and the fact that the Manor rooms included a refrigerator for no extra charge. The absence of a &quot;resort fee&quot; was nice as well. This place served its purpose as a place to sleep, store our luggage &amp; rest when not out on the Strip. The down side is that the beds are not all that comfortable and the TV service is minimal, so don't expect to watch more than news or TBS. There are movies (adult &amp; otherwise, I believe), but I didn't watch any of that, so I'm not sure what they cost.Another problem was that I requested a non-smoking room and I believe that my room, while not designated either way, was originally a smoking room, since it had a distinct smoke smell to it. It was an immediate turnoff, but as there was no ashtray, I can't say if the smoking was done on the sly or if the room was designated as &quot;non-smoking&quot; and then not properly cleaned. It wasn't enough of a problem to complain about. When I arrived, there was no refrigerator in the room (despite &quot;all&quot; manor rooms having them according to advertisement). My husband called the front desk and one was sent over fairly quickly, so no problems there. They did have to pull it out of another room, though, so I have a feeling that they are short on fridges.The actual casino and surrounding property, including the main tower, restaurants and the like, is VERY crowded at all times of the day and night. You are forced to walk through a mall-like shopping area on the way to the manor rooms or walk through reception and around the property. The salespeople are very pushy and frequently try to ask you questions or sell you stuff, even when you are dragging luggage and obviously checking out of the hotel. This creates a traffic jam and a lot of delays when trying to move through the hotel. The circus acts are cute, but the bleacher style seating area is cramped and made of hard plastic. It doesn't make you feel very comfortable. the area is small, so most times when you are interested in watching the show, there is no place to sit anyway.I feel that this place might be a good place for parents with kids due to the Adventuredome area and to a lesser degree, the midway and the circus acts, but for childless people in their 30s, this place was too tacky and hectic for our taste. Once in the room it was okay, but there are other places to stay for a similiar price that wouldn't be a zoo. If price is a concern, try downtown or a property off the strip. The bus service is fairly good in Las Vegas and some, like the Orleans, have shuttles. I definitely won't be back and honestly, I think this Circus is on its last legs. To think the owners are the same as the Mandalay Bay is a bit shocking!"
502,,"Was here for a seminar but the meeting room was absolutely freezing cold. The maintenance person made some attempts to alter the thermostat but was unsuccessful. Beware if you're bringing your family to this property -- a &quot;gentleman's club&quot; is right next door and adult magazine racks are on the sidewalk in front of hotel. Carpets are old, stained, wrinkly and stretched. Staff seems to care less about customer concerns. Property looks very worn and dated. Safety may be a concern -- there are some shady characters wandering around near the hotel property. Would not recommend this facility to anybody."
503,,"Just wanted to say that we have just returned from a 2 week stay at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon....we had a great time. The 2 bedroom appartment was great, perhaps a little tired in places, but it was very clean, air conditioning was working the whole time of our stay. A dead battery in the smoke detector which was pinging was replaced the same day. Swimming pool was great as this could be used from 8.00 am till Midnight which was marvellous as the temperature was still in the 90's late at night. It was close to several supermarkets &amp; eateries. It is about a 15-20 minute easy drive to the strip with free parking at all of the major hotels. While there, we travelled to the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Hoover Dam &amp; Red Rock Canyon. An Excellent holiday had by all!"
504,,"The front desk attendant was nice and very helpful. The rooms were smaller than I had expected, but because the price was so right on, it didn't really matter. Noise was not a problem as long as we kept the window closed. (Traffic noise) One thing that I did not like was that they did not clean your room every day. We received fresh towels and more coffee when we asked... but I kinda like the coming back to the room and having your bed made. Kids loved the jacuzzi style tub in the bathroom and the hot tub near the pool. Location was ok... a very short drive to strip... close to popular grocery stores/drug stores/ fast food. All in all it was a great trip!"
505,,"Admittedly, many casino hotels offer better rooms for less money. You also have to park far from your room, pay for internet and other services, wait on line for check-in, and be tempted by the casino at every moment. I come to Vegas often, and I've stayed in this hotel several times. It is clean, affordable, offers fast, free internet, and every room has it's own kitchenette. Plus, you can park right outside your room. It is across the street from the Hard Rock hotel, and provides easy access to the strip. If you don't have a car, do not stay here. But if you have a car and are looking for this type of place, you'll be very pleased."
506,,"I stayed at the Comfort Inn and Suites over President's Day Weekend when I was in town for a large volleyball tournament. The hotel was very loud at night, but that was not the problem of the hotel it was lots of kids staying there with their teams.Our room was nice and new. The hotel is obviously new. However, we had ants in our bathroom coming out of the wall the first night. When I called the front desk I was told there was only one person working and I had to go down myself and get the spray and spray myself.Then I tried to use two vending machines for bottled water. One ate my money and the other gave me pop. The front desk did give me my money back, but come on now. Finally, the TV in our room did not work. After the experience with the ants I did not bother trying to get the TV fixed.The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle. Not too sure about the neighborhood down the street from the hotel, but that is part of Vegas.They did have free computer to use in lobby and that was nice. Staff was helpful as they could be, but seemed like they need to have two people on duty at night, not one.This was a so so stay for me and not sure if I would recommend in future."
507,,"Nice hotel, very friendly staff and located short walk from the strip (5-10 minute walk from Wynns &amp; Encore). It's also within walking distance of the light rail system. Hotel, rooms and pool were clean. The pool currently overlooks Wynns &amp; Encore, but it's located just off the street and entrance to the garage. Therefore, you'll hear traffic noise. The pool area is not very big, so if there are noisy guests or kids you'll have nowhere to seek quietness. Free self parking offered. Very comfortable bed - double beds were not offered. Free connection to your airline check-in site is offered, so you can print your boarding pass in the lobby. Wireless connection is offered in your room. I would stay here again."
508,,"After a nightmare with a SouthWest airlines, we had to stay in Vegas for 4 hours in the middle of the night before our next flight. This Courtyard by Marriott hotel was very comfortable and quiet. The bed was one of the best ever! Even at 2am, they have a nice offering of snacks and Tim, the night auditor was so FANTASTIC! He arranged our early morning taxi pick up, and was so friendly. Off the strip, but only 10 minutes from the airport- great place to stay! Thanks so much!"
509,,"This hotel is in an easy to access location in north Las Vegas if you're doing business in Summerlin. My main complaint about the hotel was the air conditioning units. Rather than having a thermostat in the room, there are window units that are LOUD. I can normally sleep through anything but woke up every hour with the cycling of this AC unit.Upon arrival, my coworker was allowed to check in early, but I was not. This is odd considering that I am a Marriott Rewards member and he is not. The first room I finally got into smelled very heavily of ammonia (the urine kind, not the cleaning kind.) No amount of airing out the room helped, so I requested to be placed in another room and was accommodated promptly.The bathroom and sheets were clean enough, and the mattress was reasonably comfortable. There were an abundance of pillows so I could choose one that fit me fairly well."
510,,"I was in a bind, while on business in Las Vegas, NV, and I found Crestwood Suites to be a &quot;Life Saver&quot;! The rooms were clean and I found the small kitchen to help out tremendously. Location is perfect, near airport and across the street from Las Vegas outlets with affordable shopping, also right down the street from town square and the strip. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous, the service was prompt and if in any problems, just relay your issues to the front desk and they will do their best to work with you to resolve them, even if personal"
511,,"Excellent location, great staff, tremendous value......stay off the strip and enjoy the REAL Las Vegas......"
512,,Great Hotel. We got a 950 sq feet room for less than $50 per night. It had full kitchen. and living room. We even got free tickets to one of the vegas shows through conceierge service.
513,,"Great place to stay! We enjoyed the option of having the continential b'fast, the central location worked really well and the staff were very pleasant and quick to accommodate."
514,,"Spouse &amp; I sought a quiet restful hotel for the end of our CA-NV vacation that didn't include noise &amp; raucousness of slot machines &amp; gambling. Reviewed AAA info &amp; found this hotel where no gambling or slot machines exist. Our reservations were honored even though we arrived early, were able to check in &amp; offered freshly baked cookies. Our room was beautifully appointed, clean. The hotel's location to the airport was a huge plus for us as we were departing early the next day. We couldn't figure out if the hotel was open for cocktails, appetizers or whatever.We went down to the lounge area after check in &amp; found the lounge area dark. So we went to Applebee's across the parking lot from the hotel &amp; had a good dinner &amp; drinks. This is a great place to stay but you have to know what you are getting for your $$$."
515,,"Well, at least the linens seemed clean and the maids did okay. But I had expensive stuff UPSd to me while I was there and they said they didn't get it. When I got home I found out they signed for it and I had a name. I called them and they said they would forward it to me but they never did. Dollar loss: $300. The stuff probably ended up in a pawn shop since there are plenty of those nearby. .There were people coming and going at all hours. I heard people in the lobby talking about &quot;this police report,&quot; &quot;that police report..&quot; No surprise to me as I think I saw hookers and johns and drug dealers/users lurking around. They have a guy who wears a baseball cap who calls himself the &quot;security guard.&quot; He also apparently acts as the night maintenance man because they finally---after I went to the desk four times to complain that I couldn't get any cable on the TV---and he yelled at me telling me he was not a TV expert. They never did fix the TV. My third day there I told them in the morning I would be staying two more days. But they went into my room and cleaned it out anyway. They finally found me another room that exited on the street. I parked my car on the street in front of this room for about half an hour in the middle of the night and when I went to move the car I had a parking ticket. The neighborhood is one you do not want to be in at high noon let alone at night. I double-bolted my door and hoped for the best. Nobody at the desk has a clue about anything and you wait there and drum your fingers while the desk-person does this or that, talking on the phone etc, treating you as an undesirable imposition.. And the two extra days I was there they nailed me for over $100 instead of their so-called bargain rate of $30.00/night. Altogether I think four nights there cost me $230. They have an adjacent offstreet parking lot. You feel like running from that parking lot to your room expecting a hail of bullets from shoot-outs. Bottom line: If this is the best you can do on a trip to Vegas---you can't afford to go to Vegas!"
516,,"We stayed here for 2 nights last week. We wanted to stay off the strip to save some $$ and we were on our way to the Grand Canyon anyway. If you have a car, it's easy enough to get to the strip or downtown. Originally, the check-in clerk put us on the 6th floor but after seeing the casino rooftop from our window, we went back to the desk and she gave us a room on the 11th floor without any problem. The rooms are large, with a floor-to-ceiling window. Beds were very comfortable. There was no smoke smell outside of the casino and it was very quiet all night. The casino itself was large with a good variety of new slots and $5 BJ tables. Drink service was very good. It was really quiet in there on Thursday night, a little more crowded on Friday but still easy to get any machine or get a seat at a BJ table. I found the slots by the elevators to be tight but they seemed a little better on the other side of the casino. My wife and I played for several hours and came out fairly even. Overall, a very nice stay!"
517,,"Overall, this is an OK motel with decent rooms- but you get what you pay for.I stayed at this motel for five nights during the annual CES trade show.This budget chain is located in a shady-looking part of town, about a mile north of the strip, next to a few adult stores. It's definitely not a good area, but doesn't look too unsafe either.I saw three different rooms during this trip. The rooms are sized acceptably, clean, and neat. However, the beds aren't the most comfortable; the air is dry, and the heater is loud.Free continental breakfast and daily newspaper was a nice touch for a cheap motel. However, the advertised free wireless internet is located only near the office. Based on the three rooms I moved around in to find wireless, I estimate less than a third of the rooms will have wi-fi signal. However, the staff were always friendly and willing to help (in switching rooms), and internet is also available at the computers in the office.For the price, I would stay there again. Still, this is not a hotel to vacation at."
518,,"Great location for my golfing needs (TPC Summerlin) 10min away.Strip an easy drive 15min.Great contemporary &quot;W&quot; style/feel to the place, rooms with full fridge/kitchen...newDoes always smell nice, any part of the hotel.Great beds/bathGreat gymGreat DIY washing room.Great morning breakfast's/after noon snack/sFree internet/nice TV/DVDOutside BBQ &amp; pool if you don't want to smole out your room.5 min to Red Rock Resort Casino + some restaurants.I had a room well away from the elevators (by luck) but they do seem to make a loud noise when the door opens, so ask to be away from them.I'll be back next year (used STARWOOD points) for this trip"
519,,"SOME of the rooms are actually &quot;suite&quot; sizes, but not all. I had a &quot;Junior Suite&quot; comped me for three nights. It was like an average-sized hotel room actually, and DID have a chair, and a little stool as well to sit on. The guard inside the lobby told me that I had the &quot;middle&quot; room, and that there were others that were about the size of a big closet, and a &quot;real&quot; suite that was actually bigger than my room. Though the building itself is very old, the &quot;redo&quot; of the inside is very nice. Everything is modern and clean as far as I can tell. No bathtub in my room, but the glass-enclosed shower was just fine for me. The only real complaint I had was that the AC unit on the wall blows air directly on the bed, rather than out in the room. Kind of hard to sleep because of that. Parking was pretty close, and was free for my entire stay. Had to cross the street to park but not that far. Short walk to Freemont Street area. Felt fairly safe walking. I could hear some traffic noise at night from in the room, but the AC covered most of it (except the occasional ambulance or police siren.) Earplugs would have blocked most if not all noise out. No noisy neighbors or rowdy kids that I could see, though I was not there on the weekend. There was a gym there for the guests (no charge,) and I believe it even had some dumbbells included. At any rate, there was a universal machine that could get the job done if nothing else. Several treadmills and maybe a bike were also included. It's right off the lobby. Overall, a nice stay, and I would have paid for the room and will likely stay there again if I'm not looking to be right on Freemont Street. The Chinese food in the El Cortez Cafe was pretty good...service was a bit slow though."
520,,Stayed here and it has all the amenities a vegas traveler needs! Truth is no one ever plans to stay in when their in Vegas if they are what are they doing in Vegas? The Hotel rooms are tasteful great bathroom and comfy beds! The free breakfast was delicious and not to mention the open bar :)! hotel is conveniently located a walk away from the strip..restaurants..and convenient stores!! :)
521,,"Went TDY to Nellis AFB and stayed at the ES because I thought we would get a great rate (got $75 per night at the Tulsa ES back in June with the Military discount). Per diem for Military is $105 per night, ES charged me $103 plus tax because my Gov Travel Card had the wrong 6th digit, go figure. In the end my money man back in albuquerque paid the tax.The free All you can eat breakfast and 2 hours of STRONG free drinks makes this THE place to stay. Great parking, good food, swans???Needed towels and a phone book, they were at my door LITERALY 15 seconds after I hung up!I faced south, no airplane noise. The only complaint is that the shuttle to the strip ended at 1030pm. However, the driver took my group to the strip a couple of times when he didn't have to. Very nice people."
522,,"The Emerald Suites on Cameron is kind of a quirky place - likely a converted apartment building, instead of a purpose-built motel. I suspect this because of several things:- although the buildings are 3-story, they don't have elevators, which can be difficult for persons with mobility issues or a lot to lug around (and probably gives the housekeeping staff a good cardio workout!). I wound up on 3, but didn't mind since it meant no chance of some heavy-footed plodder above me.- the rooms aren't laid out like most &quot;extended-stay&quot; ones - they have separate bedrooms (without a phone - which can be a challenge) and large kitchens.- the finishes aren't motel-like, including the absence of drapes - or anything to hook them on (the importance of which is detailed below).That being said, my room was comfortable, with a trim-level akin to a discount chain (Red Roof, Econo-Lodge) and was waaay cheaper than the nearby Orleans (especially with their &quot;activity/spa&quot; fee and daily internet charges), where I was attending an event.There were, however, some issues that keep me from giving this facility an robust endorsement:1) The internet service is via an ethernet(&quot;cat-5&quot;) cable, instead of wireless, and while it's free, the service was maddeningly inconsistent; constant stalling, failures to load pages, and response that frequently reminded me of the wonderful days of &quot;dial-up&quot;. The staff tried resetting the server, which helped once, but the second time when it got no better I was advised that &quot;if someone's downloading a movie it can get really slow&quot;. Great!I wasted a LOT of time trying to just do things like check e-mail or research attractions - if you need reliable service for work-related things there's a good chance you'll be pulling on your hair after a short time.They have some cables to lend, but the one I got was in bad shape. I originally thought it might be the issue, so I got one at Big Lots (just $4).2) The lack of drapes (just blinds on the sliding balcony door and bedroom window) lead to a big surprise when I went to bed the first night; an annoying level of light leaking into the room (from the fixtures that illuminate the sidewalks between buildings). I could face the mirrored closet door and see myself - with the lights off! Luckily I could borrow a tablecloth and clips from a vendor friend at the event to cover the blinds. 3) My unit (and others, it appeared) had a noticeable gap at the bottom of the door; this increased hallway noise and meant that the smells of pan-fried chicken and charred toast wafted into my room (with the latter giving me a start - thought it might be a fire!). Got a towel from housekeeping to put across the threshold. 4) There's a business just north of the property that appears to do metal fabrication and feels compelled to bang a lot of large metal containers around very early in the morning - it sounded like a dumpster-truck driver training class! My room was on the south side, so I only noticed it on the days I was outside early - no issue if you're not sleeping past 8AM.I have to say that everyone I encountered on the staff was very pleasant and courteous - must've had a turnover from the staff from other reviews.As for that other reviewer's complaint about hot water - I take showers that only last about 4-5 minutes, and the water was ankle-deep in the tub when I was done. If you're still covered in soap 30 MINUTES into a warm/hot shower, you've got bigger issues to worry about - like avoiding bankruptcy from budget-busting home water heating bills! Just what a desert town needs - people taking 50-gallon showers!"
523,,"i booked this hotel a week prior to arriving. it seemed like a good deal. me and my friend are celebrating our birthdays. we arrived late friday to see that the entire lower level is under remodeling. which was disturbing caused they mentioned nothing of this. we went out via the shuttle service, the shuttle driver conned us into beliving he was giving us free V.I.P. passes into Tangerine. We gave him a really good tip. come to find out there were promoters all over the strip and casino handing theese passes out for free!!! Saturday we were woke up at 6 am by pounding hammers from the remodeling below! we woke up rather early and got ready to spend the day downtown fremont street. the water went out in the morning so we couldnt take showers! they gave us no warning or apology! we came back from fremont street to discover fans scattered about in our room beacuse it had flooded after we left! we called the manager and went to speak with her. she accused us of leaving the water on intentionally and told us how we could be liable for thousands in repairs. that ruined our saturday night needless to say which turned out to be our birthdays. they moved us into seperate rooms which was the only proper thing they did all weekend. the room they moved us into showed signs of an electrical fire in one of the outlets! i have pic of all of this i will be uploading ASAPso far they charged me 200 on my credit card which is UNAUTHORIZED! as of now there being investigated by my bank for fraudulant charges!"
524,,"We got a room here for New Year's Eve celebration. It does not look too far from the Strip on the map, but you'd have to take a highway to get to the strip, which is about 20-min drive. If you plan on drinking, park your car at a hotel and get a cab. Due to the distance and heavy traffic near the Strip, you may end up paying $30-$40 for a cab one-way, so you're really not saving much money. We paid $75 for a king bed. But add the cab fares and the 2-hour-wait for a cab (cabs in Vegas cannot be flagged, reservations or pick-ups at casino hotels are required), we might as well pay a bit more to stay on the Strip and avoid the hassle. The room is big, but has a strange layout. The room is divided into two sections, the first with just the bed and a small bathroom while the second is the couch, TV and a kitchen. We like to watch tv when we go to bed and this was an inconvenience to us as the TV could not be moved. The pull-out couch was filthy and has obviously not been cleaned for months. I would not sleep there unless you wanna get bed bug bites. The hotel staff was NOT helpful at all. I dialed 0 and asked them if they could get us a number for a cab company and they did not even do that! They said we would have to come to the lobby and look up the yellow book ourselves. In other words, customer service was non-existent."
525,,The air conditioner is loud and one of the fan cannot work. Some lights were broken. The carpet is dirty. The window was broken and cannot be opened. We spent over$100 per night. It wasn't worth it.
526,,"I had to stay at this hotel because of a specific meeting. It is very basic and has been well used. A guest had let his dog out in the hallway to go to the bathroom and I stepped over several piles on the way to the room. During the weekend, it looked like there was a steady stream of &quot;paid&quot; visitors that came and went.It was ok if you needed a room to sleep in and spent no time in the hotel but otherwise I would not stay here."
527,,"Hotel was clean with a nice and helpful staff. We had to check out of South Point Hotel Casino &amp; Spa for two days during our trip due to them being booked solid, so we chose this Fairfield Inn. I may just be spoiled by the rooms/facility at South Point, but I was pretty disappointed when we came here. The rooms with double beds were very small. The double beds almost seemed as though they were twin beds. The bathroom was very tiny too. There were only one set of elevators that at one point only one was working. I would pay a bit more money to stay somewhere else. The lobby and the breakfast was also nice."
528,,"I have stayed at other Fairfield Inns and decided to give the Fairfield Inn South a try when I was in Vegas for a long weekend. I am sorry to say that I don't plan on staying here again and this is why:Being the end of September, it was still in the high 90s during the day and the high 70s/low 80s at night. This meant that I needed the air conditioning on in my room. The problem is, either you are in the North Pole or the Sahara Desert - no in between. The HVAC unit on the floor is right next to the bed.Not only it is very noisy when it is on, there are no dials on the unit for high cool/low cool, high fan/low fan or whatever.All there is is a thermostat unit on the wall. The thermostat has a button for on or auto, and one for heat/cool/off. No high/low fan button. And you can adjust the temperature with the little up/down arrows. Here lies the problem -because you can't put the fan on high or low the unit only has 1 function - blow freezing cold Arctic air out at a high rate and when the room cools to the temperature on the thermostat, it shuts off. No low fan to run. Therefore you are either freezing or boiling in the room. No in between. I got very little sleep the 2 nights I was there because I was up constantly all night adjusting the thermostat. It was terrible!! I would never stay at this hotel again unless they add a high/low button to the thermostat.Other than the HVAC problem and the fact that the bed was right next to the unit (maybe 2 feet from it!) , the hotel was fine. The room was very small but they managed to have a big desk with plenty of room on it and a little armchair &amp; footstool. Small closet. The king size bed was fabulous as were the wonderful feather pillows. The staff were all very nice and the breakfast was good. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure.I did not have a suite, I just had a standard room. I did not hear any planes overhead (yes, the hotel is fairly close to the airport runways but so are the Mandalay Bay &amp; many other strip hotels!) perhaps because the noisy HVAC unitl drowned them out! and I did not notice any smell in the hallways."
529,,"We have stayed in every lodging destination in Mesquite and by far this is our favorite. This particular visit...I telephoned the manager, Patty Brown, who I have always admired as a friendly, caring, hard working , hands on manager. I wanted to get the best rate for my 5 couple friends, and she did everything possible, looked into golf packages for us and gave us a great competitive rate. The rooms are very nice, the suites beautiful with balconies. They will accommodate pets on the first floor one wing,(See what you get if you take a pet to the Virgin River! Hold your nose and don't take off your shoes in that wing..) Falcon Ridge has e a top notch hot breakfast. No gaming, but minutes to all casinos, so it is relaxing, peaceful, great views on top of the knoll, and quiet. I will and have recommended this hotel to everyone I know with travel plans through or to Mesquite."
530,,"Fiesta Rancho is a hotel/casino in North Las Vegas, which is a fair distance away from the Strip. As a result, the room rates here are considerably lower than what you will find elsewhere in Vegas. Unfortunately, you pretty much get what you pay for with this place.The casino is in a rather low-rent section of the city, and the casino's parking structure is not even remotely close to the hotel. So you'll have to park your car outside in a rather iffy area, although they do have bicycle security that monitors the lots constantly.Rooms are fair at best. My heater didn't work, and I had to call somebody to repair it. The bathroom smelled moldy and unpleasant.Front desk was not very professional. Hung up on me after placing me on hold for over five minutes. Forgot to tell me basic information I needed before checking into the room. The lady who currently works at the desk has real problems speaking coherent English -- she just mumbles into the phone.Unlike other casinos, there is no breakfast buffet here, so you'll have to eat at the 24-hr Denny's if you're looking to eat before 11:00 or so. The casino itself is small and dingy compared to other local casinos. This place is an older casino, and pretty much looks it.My advice is to go the newer Texas Station casino across the street, which is ten times better than this place, and costs roughly about the same."
531,,"This is our third stay at Fitzgeralds in just over a year and again I have not experienced any of the negatives that some of the reviewers write about. Stayed 4 nights and everything was fantastic. The room was clean and ready for us at check in. The staff in all areas from bar/wait to slot/pit was the friendliest we came across in the entire downtown district. Hats off to Fitzgeralds, you gave us another great get away."
532,,"Spent last weekend at the Four Seasons, and now I will not be able to stay anywhere else. Yes, it's expensive, but we appreciated being removed from the glitz etc. of Vegas, yet being able to enjoy everything Vegas has to offer on our own terms. Strip view is worth the upgrade. We ate at the restaurants in the Mandalay Bay Casino area, and were impressed by Border Grill and Strip Steak. We were happy to leave it all behind at the end of the night, and slip back into the luxury of the Four Seasons."
533,,"We have stayed at the Fremont a few times in the past. We were perfectly happy there until the last day of our last trip. We were in Room 602 and were getting ready for our 11:OO AM check-out when we saw a cockroach sitting on the bathroom sink. As anyone reading this knows,there is no such thing as just one cockroach! Needless to say,we will never stay there again."
534,,"Yes, Like everyone else you wonder what you get for $20- $40.00 a night. We got the 4th floor I asked about non smoking and Julie, OH, Yes friendly Julie at the check in, she was real helpful all the time. She had said it was a non smoking floor.  And you could not smell anything in the hall or the room.. The room were clean as all others say. The room was about 12x12 without the bathroom. Bath smaller but Clean. Like some had stated there was some noise from Golden Nugget but no big deal its just about done. Your not there to sleep all night !!! Get the coupon book from the Golde Gate Players Club for 2 for one meals, drinks free shrimp. If you want to get around to the strip and back or anywhere in vegas streets you can do a 3 day pass now for $15.00.  We went to the Fremont Sat morning for the buffet, for $9.99 you get Prime Rib, han, made to order omlets, shrimp, and all the goodies, fresh fruit.. Went back sunday but the had a Champain Brunch $9.99.. So we went around to the Califorina Hotel had a buffet for $5.95 Small buffet scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, couple other items and coffee milk juice..  WE had one dinner at the Golden Gate Restaurant Meat Loaf with coupon buy on get one for $10.99 was very good. Had burgers fries was good.. I check out on line that it was cheaper to take the GRAY LINE BUS from the Airport to Downdown/ Fremont for $16.00 per person (round trip). Just go out door #10 at the Baggage Clam to buy a ticket.  But if you have 4-5 people take a cab and split it. They say it cost about $24.00 to go Downtown one way.. Fitzgarlds Casino on Fremont Street has $2.00 Black Jack.  Calf. Hotel $3.00 Black Jack (GOLDEN GATE) If you read this, NOT EVERYONE WANT&quot;S TO SPEND $10.00 A HAND ON BLACK JACK WHEN IT COMES TO A FRI-SAT NIGHT. CAN'T YOU LEAVE ONE TABLE AT $5.00 FOR THE NIGHTS. ONE TABLE FOR THE POOR WORKING MAN. I SAW EMTPY TABLES AT $25.00 UP, THAT COULD BE FULL IF IT WAS A $5.00 TABLE..  All I can say if you want to pay big bucks for the Strip, for a bigger room, for snobby hotel personel. Thats the place to be. The Strip is good for the first timers to see the sights.  If you want a more laid back friendly area, Cheaper price for food &amp; drinks come to Fremont.. Or go out side of town, off the Strip.. Hope this helps..."
535,,"The room was was really dirty and smelly. Never was our room cleaned or beds make on our two night stay. The shower did not have hot water. The remote did not have any batteries. When we arrived we along with 20 other guests had to climb the stairwell because the elevators were not working (i swear this is true folks). To top it all off, the hotel checkout clecrk wanted us to pay a utility service charge, that I refused to pay. Worst hotel ever! Please tell your friends and loved ones."
536,,We visit Vegas every November and this is the fourth time we have stayed here. This year we stayed in one of the premium rooms. They have been updated and are clean. The mattresses are very comfortable. The shuttle service to Bill's is an added bonus. The breakfast buffet is great and inexpensive at $6.50 per person. One of the food stations makes made to order omelets and eggs. The prime rib dinner at the Cortez dining room is to die for. Staff and serving personel are friendly. No problems with water pressure or temperature in the shower. We particularly like the fact that we can turn on the coffee maker and have coffee in our room before going downstairs to breakfast. We will be back next year!
537,,"My friends and I have been traveling to Las Vegas over the course of the last month for work. We are not really into the high dollar casinos and are were just looking for a decent place to play cards. We stumbled upon the Gold Spike by accident…it was the $3 Sexy Blackjack sign that drew us in. What is $3 Sexy Blackjack, basically it is $3 minimum Blackjack dealt by pretty young girls in tight black shorts and white t-shirts. Since that first night we have been going back twice or three times a week and have gotten to know the staff pretty well. Here is the long and short of it. The dealers are pretty, nice and will talk to you. This is unlike the Asian drones at most of the other casinos in town. There are three Blackjack tables and a roulette table, so talking with and getting to know the dealers and pit bosses is very easy. We have spent some quality time with pit bosses Susan, Peter, and Rita, and the great dealers Nicole, Sasha, Tina, Mimi, and others. Contrary to the one review Rita is very cool. Mark the manager who has been there every night we have, is one of the most professional and patient people that I have come across. Hey it’s a casino people get drunk and obnoxious, but Mark handles them with respect and patience. I have not stayed at the hotel and don’t plan to…I am a Hilton points snob, but I will continue to go the Spike to gamble with my new found friends. So if you head in and find Susan tell her that Keith, Joe, and Dave sent you."
538,,"Until I actually have money to blow at a fancy hotel/casino, I just wanted something close to the convention cnter where I was headed, and CHEAP! This hotel was so inexpensive mid-week compared to neighboring hotels (as in half the price) that I was scared about what I was getting myself into. Surprisingly I found an older, but renovated, well-loved and clean hotel. The room on the tenth floor had all the usual amenities and a very large window with a view facing north. The bed, the carpet, the drapes, the bathroom, all were near-new and I found no reason to complain. Small outdoor pool is open 24 hours and there is a cardio/weight room on the second floor. Also there is a restaurant, casino, and in-house magic/fire show (none of which I saw). The desk staff can be a bit dingy, but for the price I was willing to put up with that. One ding worth mentioning is lack of FREE wireless internet -- it costs $12/day.Would definitely return, and definitely made my friends jealous when I told them about my find."
539,,"This was a convenient place to stay after flying into Las Vegas for the night. We were headed out to southern Utah the following morning. We also stayed here the night before flying home. We frequently stay at Hampton Inns while traveling, alternating with bed and breakfast establishments. This was the best Hampton Inn we've ever stayed at. Everything seemed upgraded a notch - more spacious rooms, better furnishings, more breakfast options. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay, brief as it was, and will book again under similar circumstances."
540,,"Layout is typical Hampton Inn - but the newness shows everywhere from the sparkling floors in the lobby, the clean elevators, and most importantly in every part of the rooms. There is pride among the staff - the lady who came to get us at the airport at 2:00 AM, was friendly and chatty. She was especially warm to my children who were beyond beat after a six hour flight from the east. This hotel is not particularly close to the airport - about 4 miles - but they come quickly, and drop off on a posted schedule in the morning. We would definitely return."
541,,"While the facilities may not be extravagant, they were Very comfortable, clean, and most of all the staff, all of them that I encountered were most accommodating and truly went out of their way to “serve” us. Most facilities just cringe when teams come in but the staff certainly did not show it to us if they did! There were many examples……courteous upon check in, offered water before/after my run, breakfast to go bags early morning departure flight – great!, no charge for one of our players who ended up staying with his mom at a hotel downtown that I was not aware of, sending home my daughter’s shirt she left in the dresser not charge, rollaway at no charge, good hot breakfast, …. To name a few!I will certainly stay there again for future soccer tournaments and other visits to Vegas."
542,,"The pictures make this property look a little more posh than it is, but it's clean and comfortable with a great staff. I enjoyed staying here for a business trip - it was perfect for this kind of trip. It's just across the freeway from the strip and has easy access to the big hotels just by following Tropicana. It's about a mile from Palms and Rio, and is a short drive to the rental car center by following Dean Martin Dr. to Warm Springs Rd, then across the freeway - no need to drive I-15 at rush hour either. The hotel has a small bar and lounge - convenient for unwinding right at the hotel before retiring to the room.The room is reliably economy Hampton Inn - but is clean, well, furnished, and comfortable. I found the bed was especially good - I would give them an A+ for the bed and bedding. Free internet, though wired, was an excellent amenity.All-in-all, the perfect place for a business trip where affordability matters."
543,,"This property provides an interesting blend of a roadside motel and a mid-level hotel with comfortable amenities. Here's my assessment:Roadside Motel:• small 4 (or is it 5)-story structure with easy parking, easy access to building• located away from the action, yet located strategically close to freeways, airport, shopping, primary strip casino/hotels.• basic small cement pool with a few lawn chairs• small check in area, lobby (but tastefully decorated)• tiny business center w/two computers--complimentary usemid-level hotel:• breakfast service @11.95/person, light dinner fare @ 7.95/person• quality mattress, linens, towels, bathroom fixtures• lots of channel choices• fitness center with nice choice/quality equipment (but it closes @11pm)• variety of room choices available when making resoAlso:• Shuttle service is available to Mandalay Bay--once per hour, until about 11pm. • Neutrogena products• Room temperature was easy to control• everything was clean and in working orderSome negatives:• I stayed on a non-smoking floor, yet cigarette smoke was evident in the hallway.• desk staff was not terribly friendly or professional. I am on the fence about staying here again, mostly because there are other places in Las Vegas I like better. But the rate was competitive and it was located somewhat near my base of business activities. I highly recommend shopping around when looking for hotels--and if you have more than one day to look, do it because rates can radically fluctuate!"
544,,"What a lovely property this is. It was our third timeshare trade in Vegas and has been the best one so far. From the moment of check in when the front desk staff offered us bottled water and gave us small wrapped cocolates until we left 9 days later being wished a pleasant goodbye early in the morning, the HGVC at Flamingo did not disappoint.The non-smoking building is beautifully maintained, always being cleaned, and the staff never fail to say hello when passing you by. The housekeeping staff is quickly responsive to any requests and also very pleasant. We did not meet anyone that wasn't polite and professional during our stay. The pools at the Flamingo are beautiful, although the smaller pools that connect with mini water slides and the main water slide pool were disappointingly closed for the season. Additionally, the management had directed the pool guards to stack up and remove a great number of lounge chairs, to be put away for the season, and on the weekends, there was a definite chair shortage. It didn't bother us, as we usually will just figure out an alternate plan, but many people were grumbling about this, and I could understand why - if you are going to the Flamingo or the HGVC Flamingo, you probably wnat to spend some time at their lovely pool and should be entitled to a chair. I was not aware that the official &quot;season&quot; was over at the end of September, and therefore, many of the areas were either closed or lowly populated, including some of the pool bar areas being closed. The weather was really great, and in the 9 days that we were there, we experienced a few breezy days, a couple downright hot days, and a couple days that were chilly in the shade. It was almost too cool to swim if the area was shaded, but it was wonderful to sit on a lounge and watch all the interesting people! We made lots of friends just chatting around the pool.I personally did not use the bar service, but the drinks that people were getting, especially the frozen ones that come from the automated machines, sure did look great. One day at the smaller HGVC private pool, the bartender came around with samples of her drink of the day, The Pink Flamingo, and they were delicious. We thought that was so kind of her to share her daily drink and to give us a taste of the drink she hoped we would order. Both pools always had great music being played during the day, and of course, the habitate area with live flamingos, birds, turtles, and enormous fish are beautiful to see. Still disappointed that the water slide was closed for the season (and had trash and beer cans inside).The kitchen was well stocked and seemed to have everything we needed. Paper towels, soap, shampoo, and lotion were provided in both bathrooms (we had the two bedroom lockout unit), and we enjoyed the oversized jacuzzi tub after a long day of walking around town. I ordered groceries from Von's, and that worked out perfectly. We had a full equipped kitchen and a full refrigerator - it made it really nice at breakfast time and when you wanted a snack or beverage. What a convenient way to vacation. Our unit had a washer/dryer (detergent provided), dishwasher, garbage disposal, plenty of pots and pans, towels, and dish sponge. There were always plenty of fluffy towels and fresh linens when we asked for them. We are tidy people and always took our trash daily to the trash room and kept the unit clean and orderly - even so, we were pleasantly surprised when the housekeeping staff had come in mid-week and freshened up the towels, soaps, etc. The welcome desk tried to contact us a few times to do the timeshare tour, but we were busy and didn't respond, and they were not pushy whatsoever. We actually would have enjoyed taking the timeshare tour and will consider it next time - we were just busy this trip.Vegas is definitely a fast-paced town filled with lots of interesting people. Staying at the HGVC a bit removed from the noise and activity was a wonderful refuge, yet close enough to get to the action in no time at all. We really loved our stay here and will definitely return again."
545,,"Suites are all fitted with washer/dryer, dishwasher, coffee maker, fridge/freezer and all other kitchen appliances. Separate bath from shower, 2 TVs and lounge area. No Casino here so a quiet haven to return to at the end of a hectic day on the strip."
546,,"My company booked my hotel room late. As a result, everyone else was at the Las Vegas Hilton while I was next door at the Grand Vacations. I was sorely disappointed when I saw what I was missing out on. At my hotel, the room was small, there wasn't any restaurant (just a convenience store), and I felt like I was miles away from any action because the hotel was so quiet."
547,,"Not a huge amount of things to do in the way of amenities, but a perfect place to stay overnight on business. Great accessibility, close to some good restaurants and bars, but also far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. Book a room facing east and watch the sun rise across the mountain range!!"
548,,"Excellent hotel, very clean and comfortable.After staying 3 nights at circus circus in Las Vegas (Cirucs Circus was sooo BAD ,all the bed sheets and linen was had clearly visible HOLES!!) . However our stay here in Holiday in express for 1 night and we felt like we are in heaven. We slept so well on SO COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN BEDs.This place was so clean and had a nice heated pool outdoors and nice indoor whirlpool( bigger than most other places I have stayed!)Staff was friendly and courteous , prompt.It is abt 10 miles from the strip. If you prefer quite, clean place away from strip I would stay here.They have free breakfast ( Cinnamon Buns, Bagels/creamcheese, Fresh cut Fruits, Banna, Orange,Hard boiled eggs, Oange and Apple juice, Waffles ( cold storage),Nestle Hot chocolate and Oat meal packets, coffee,tea and flovaoured Creamers (Irish cream, Hazelnut etc!!!).)This is truely an undiscovered GEM!! I WILL NOT STAY IN STRIP instea will stay here and drive to strip."
549,,"This hotel has a surprisingly good view of the strip if you are on the right side of the hall! The room was pretty clean, the staff was pretty nice, and the hotel seemed to always be packed with cars at night, which I find comforting knowing that I'm not the only one there. However, the security probably needs to be improved a little. About 2-4 times a day, there would be a pizza flier slid under my door (probably from some kid the pizza business hired to improve sales).. And on the door, going in the side of the hotel, it clearly states &quot;no soliciting&quot; ... So either the hotel doesn't care that these people are just coming in and soliciting, or they are really oblivious to who are their guests and who are not... (I would never buy pizza from a company that does this by the way)They have a shuttle that goes to Mandalay Bay and MGM which is good. I did not use that service, since it only goes till 12AM... Which is odd, since most people in Vegas stay out till way past then, I'd assume..The bad part of the hotel is that there was NO fridge....... I hate that. I mean, you're in a desert and they have no fridge... like wtf? I paid like $80 plus $10 or $12 or so for taxes each night... I think that's probably just about the right price, although it'd be better if it was lower : )It's a good place to stay at if you're in Vegas for more than a few days, because it gives you a chance to get away from the rustle and bustle and hustle of the casinos."
550,,"Hotel was ok, nothing fancy. Two cars in the parking lot did get broken into while I was there. There are a lot of places to eat around and the hotel service was nice. Make sure to stay in a room on the third floor, as those have vaulted ceilings. There is no elevator though, so pack a light bag."
551,,"This hotel was cheap, and on the Strip (northern Strip, right across from the Stratosphere) . . . but boy, was it seedy. It had a 24-hour pool, but you couldn't have paid me to go in! I killed two roaches during a two-day stay. If you're looking for a place that's on the strip and CHEAP, this place is it -- and it does have free parking -- but it's a pit, no two ways about it. My boyfriend wasn't as offended by the roaches and general seedy atmosphere, so perhaps if you're a group of guys going to Vegas and you're looking for nothing more than a cheap bed and shower so you can blow money at the tables, this might be your place. I do NOT recommend it for a romantic vacation. I felt a bit like a &quot;working girl&quot; after a couple nights in this place!"
552,,"The only thing is the room, especially the rug, wasn't clean enough for us who has a crawling baby. The room was cozy and fairly close to the Strip. Actually, it's very close by private car, but two bus shift is necessary by public transportation."
553,,"October in Las Vegas was great – although the sun was still a bit strong, the temperature was perfect. We participated in an outdoor sporting event but we didn’t combust in to ashes like we almost did in August (don’t ask what we were thinking). When we checked in, there were two people working at the lobby hence processing two sets of guests at a time. I wasn’t worried too much about the security issue since I was with two Chippendale types (ok, not exactly) but the staff who processed us (Brady, I think and I believe he is the manager) was alert/cautious/discreet enough not to read out and announce our room number when he gave us the room key there – I was very happy with the hotel from the get go because of that. It turned out Brady is a hardworking (and/or overworking) guy - he was there when we checked in, during our stay, and when we checked out. I hope he is getting paid well. He was doing a great job. We booked a non-smoking, 2 bedrooms/2 baths suite for 3 adults and 3 children. In our room, 245, 2 bedrooms were joined by a small kitchen/dining/living room. There is a full size refrigerator in the kitchen that we packed it with snacks and drinks. The room was also equipped with a coffee maker, a microwave oven and even a toaster, stove and dishwasher. This hotel is not a smoke free hotel but we weren’t bothered by any smoke smell at all. The room windows were at the freeway side and the traffic noise was a bit loud for me; but it was no issue for the rest of the group. The airport noise didn’t bother us at all. The complimentary breakfast was great; it accommodated light to heavy eaters like fruit to burritos. The kitchen staff was efficient and they kept the food well stocked and countertops and tables clean. The swimming pool was heated and the children were very happy dipping in the early nippy morning. This hotel suited and satisfied our trip needs; price, amenity and location. If your Las Vegas stay is mainly non-gaming, this is the spot."
554,,I have stayed in Vegas many time but never at the Monte Carlo. It was a great value during the over priced Labor Day weekend. It was a low key hotel. You can't beat the location.
555,,"After reading some reviews we stil decided to stay at this Howard Johnson. I didn't expect much...BUT I was surprised when I got to the hotel!!.  I had originally booked this hotel for 1 day. I ended up staying for a week. Staff was very friendly and helpful specially the manager Omid. For the price this hotel was outstanding, they have a huge lobby and a very nice Cuban restaurant. My room was clean and was very spacious with a balcony and free internet. was very spacious with a balcony and free internet. internet. Location was ok; the hotel is conveniently located between Las Vegas Strip and Downtown, just 5 to 10 minutes away from the main casinos and parking is free everywhere. For what we paid we felt like it was a great deal. I would definitely consider staying here again. We were very pleased with our stay."
556,,"This is a great place to stay if you have a car and want to be off the strip. We stayed 4 nights and I never heard a plain (we were on floor 2 facing the parking). Service was great, they had a very yummy free breakfast, also free wii fii and parking, and the same type of room and amenities of every Hyatt place (42 flat TV, 24 hour room service with menu and ordering option on TV, nice bathroom with tub, coffee machine, fridge, big bed, sofa, working desk, nice bedding….) I love the idea of the Hyatt place, it is a basic hotel with everything you need to feel comfortable during your stay. I just love the big flat TV Wherever I go and there is a Hyatt place, I stay there. The price is great for what you get, in our opinion"
557,,"I was at your casino the very first time, May 12th in the evening. I was gambling on the slot machines with a friend, even with asking the change personel several times to get a waitress for cocktails, we couldn't get service even after spending several hundreds of dollars. I wouldn't recommend gambling here till the Casino pledges to improve their extremely poor cocktail staff service."
558,,"We stayed at The Jockey Club for a week in October 2009. We were lucky and got a suite on the 11th floor, facing The Bellagio, so we had a great view, unlike all the people on the other side of the complex. The suites are very spacious, if a little dated, and have everything you could possibly need. The location is great, and the staff are friendly and helpful (apart from the concierge guy we spoke to). Free Internet is a nice touch too, helpful if you need to check emails, check in for flights etc. The Mini market on site is reasonably priced and stocks a good selection of basics, we used it for drinks and snacks.The major problem the Jockey Club has, as others has said, is all the construction. The noise didn't really affect us, but we were very dissapointed that the pool area gets no sun at all now thanks to the massive buildings that have been built right behind it, and even on a hot Vegas day, the pool area can feel quite chilly. My In-laws were amazed when we showed them the pictures, as they remember the Jockey Club how it used to be before the construction started. The pool situation was overcome by asking at the front desk if there was another pool I could use to sunbathe. The Flamingo, about 10 minutes walk away lets non residents use their pool after 2pm, so I spent a couple of afternoons sunbathing over at their pool, not ideal, but better than the chilly Jockey Club pool!"
559,,"This hotel is billed as a nice resort in Vegas, but it's anything but. I was surprised to find that there is no option for wifi, at least in the palm tower. The rooms have ancient tube TVs, and the remote for my room did not function. There was also a stench of open sewer throughout the building the weekend of my stay. The free parking for the Palm tower is a long walk from the front door. Your other option is paying for a valet with tips.The rooms a a good size, and the restaurant area is pretty nice, but to be honest, the place feels deserted - almost too empty. It feels dead."
560,,"Thought we got a deal with a good rate..but sometimes you don't get what you pay for. Room had a musty odor,carpets were stained..ceilings also.We were awakened by the kids hanging around the pool area at 3 A.M to the sound of profuse vomiting.Fortunatley we were only staying one night..We stayed at Treasure Island for the next 6 nights..what a night and day difference. T.I. was wonderful!"
561,,"My boyfriend and I stayed there during the week of a convention. We had stayed there last year and it was okay. I now know this is because last year when we stayed there they had just bought the property from Howard Johnsons and hadn't turned it to crap yet. This time around though it was horrifying. On other occasions we have slummed it to save money but had I known the hotel had deteriorated this much in a year I would not have had a problem paying for a strip hotel or a courtyard marriott. I was two steps from sleeping in my car. I know you're thinking why did we stay - well convention week, all hotels booked, cheapest rooms were about 400 a night - I did not have $2000 handy. We stayed out as much as possible and everyday when we came back I swore we would not find our luggage in the room. It was evident the cleaning service was helping themselves to my cream and perfume. I would leave them face down in my toiletry bag and when I came back at night find them face up with the caps open. The place was deserted and when we requested to stay in a suite (which we had last year and it was nice) they said they were booked to capacity and that the suite would cost $300! Freakin liars and thieves! The hotel had NO ONE staying there - pretty obvious by the lack of um people? and um 3 cars including ours in the parking lot. When we drove to the room we passed by rooms that were obviously getting treated for pestilence. Thank goodness I brought flip flops - I never took them off in the room and showered with them. The towels were filthy with all kinds of colorful spots on them. At night every time I would hear a car sound I thought ours was getting stolen. There were no tissues in the room and the TVs seemed as though they had been bought in a garage sale and looked exactly like I had in my bedroom when I was 8 - really small and with horrible picture. We wrapped the remote with toilet paper to avoid touching it. Our first night there also a huge chunk of the AC just fell off. Some of these things are trivial yes , but I am just trying to paint the overall picture to you.And last but definitely not least! They tried to charge me a different rate. I noticed when I went to check in and demanded they change it. They said they had already put a hold on my credit card but not to worry when I checked out they would charge me the right price. When I checked out they tried to charge me for the amount they had held and they said oh sorry we accidentally deleted your reservation and can't see what price you booked - well not to worry I said because I have a printed confirmation of my booking. I told them if they tried to argue it I would call the bank and tell them it's a fraudulent charge - that's when they stopped arguing.PLEASE DON'T EVEN GO NEAR THERE!!! THEY MUST BE VIOLATING SOOOO MANY HEALTH CODES AND NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN!!"
562,,"My sister and I went on this trip to Las Vegas. We had a great time. We stayed at Bluegreen Club 36. It was a very nice place and all employees were very sweet and helpful. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days. The one thing that I would recommend to everyone is if you are going to go, either plan on spending at least a week to be able to see all that Las Vegas has to offer. We did not have enough time although we did see alot. I also would recommend not renting a car and to take advantage of the Duece Double Decker bus that takes you back and forth on the strip. That saves alot of time and headaches of having to find parking. Also you may want to plan out what to do each day. That would have saved us alot of time and we might have got to see more than we did. Las Vegas really has alot to see and do. We were both really pleased with the vacation."
563,,"Spent 2 nights. room was clean, water hot, and bed comfortable - what more can you ask for when all you need to do is put your head down for a while, and a place to change and shower. Had never stayed on Freemont Street before. It was great - watched the music show, street painters expertise with spray paint cans was amazing and there was a band playing on a stage down the enclosed street. Food prices at nearby Buffet was excellent.I would stay there again."
564,,"Had to change rooms because our first room (219), the air conditioner didn't blow cool air. The air conditioners are placed in a bad position next to the bathroom and it will take forever to cool the motel room (if you're lucky to get one that works). Rooms smelled funny, contained cheaply made furniture and the mattresses were worn out. None of the pictures that are shown on the travelodge website are accurate. Bathroom looked like it came from the early 80s. Swimming pool looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of months. One look at the elevator would make you not want to take it for fear of it malfunctioning. Wash your hands after touching anything at that motel. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? Heck no. I wouldn't even recommend it to a rat."
565,,"This hotel is just what you look for in an economy business hotel. Nice breakfast in the morning, free wireless internet, clean rooms with fridge/microwave/toaster, inexpensive, and clean. The beds aren't that great, but the rest is very good."
566,,"I travel all over the US almost every month and have not seen such friendly and helpful staff. I had a very serious issue with my laptop and the manager went above and beyond to save my day. I would have been in a big mess if he was not there to rescue me from the disaster. Housekeeping was excellent. Very clean and neat place to stay. I will highly recommend my family and friends to stay there. Great for people travelling with pets. Great experience, no problems at all."
567,,"promised noon check in. Unable to check in until after 2pm. After check in we went ot rooms and found beds made but bathrooms unattended. called front desk and they sent supervisor up to rooms. Maid failed to clean bathroom remove used towels, clean jacuzzi tub, toilet paper and tissues were not renewed. 1 towel,1 hand towel. For 2 people.Goilet over flowed the tank, not the bowl, the tank. I repaired, as room would have been flooded by the time someone got there.Outlets were hit and miss. Some worked some did not.Microwave worked intermittently. Grounds were clean.Pet friendly but the dogs down the hall kept yapping all night"
568,,"The La Quinta Inn on Nellis is a beautiful hotel! The entire property looks like it is brand new, and the service was top notch. I had been sent to North Las Vegas for business, and was not to excited because I have heard some negatives about the area, but boy was I surprised. The level of service I received was excellent. As soon as I walked into the hotel I was greeted by a cheerful, WELCOME TO LA QUINTA! I thought those days were long gone. The check-in process was a breeze, and the rooms were amazing. The entire staff was very friendly, and helpful. I had a great nights sleep, and the beds were so comfortable I felt like I was sleeping on clouds. They also had a great indoor pool and spa that I enjoyed a great deal, and the complimentary deluxe continental breakfast was delicious, and a nice amenity to be offered every morning! If I am ever in Las Vegas, Nevada I will be staying at the La Quinta Inn on Nellis."
569,,"I found this hotel online it was in the area we were visiting. The hotel is easy to find and is right off of the highway. Even though it is near the highway the hotel itself is very quiet and well kept. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was nice and quiet. They have a nice breakfast with waffles, yogart, cereal etc... Since we will be frequenting the Las Vegas area in the future we are planning on staying here again."
570,,"I visited here in June 2009. Main Street Station sleeping rooms are so nice. Clean and fresh rooms. The bedding was soft, fresh and appeared new. The bathroom was even fresh looking! My room view looking towards downtown was nice. The night lights were so colorful right from my hotel room. I felt safe and I felt clean my whole visit here at this hotel. The buffet meal in the large resturant was good. What a selection of foods. The wait staff was also so sweet! This hotel is such a good buy! The hotel is close to the city bus line and I rode the city bus to and from &quot;The Strip&quot;. The hotel is also 2 blocks or less to &quot;The Fremont Experience.&quot; There's even an enclosed people walkover to the neighboring hotel and more shops! Cool! What a great stay!"
571,,"I could not believe how bad the hotel was. In most places you can see that the hotel has a three star rating. That's a lie. The hotel is a one star. Most of the rooms are rented weekely or monthly. Therefore you have people actually living there, and not the best kind of people. As soon as I checked in in the hotel, I went to my room and saw a &quot;lady&quot; running, while a guy was chasing her while cursing. People walk around with beers covered with paper bags, and you find trashed people all over the hotel. The pool is fool of scary looking people, so don't even think of relaxing at the pool. As soon as I got to my room, I was ready to check out, specially after my family saw and heard these people chasing at each other. So I took the phone and wanted to call front desk... the phone did not work. I packed everything in my car, and went to the front desk and tell them I was cheching out, and hand them the keys. My reservation was for two nights, but I stayed only half an hour. I was supposed to get a refund for the second night, but went I called my travel agency they said that the hotel told them that I stayed 2 nights, and that the first day I checked in at 3am. That was not true, since I traveled from LA to LV and got to the hotel at 6pm, and checked out at 6:30. My recommendation: Dont even think about going to this hotel with family. This hotel is only for people planning to stay forever in vegas, have a trashy life and not enjoying vegas the way you should. I left and booked 2 nights in the Sahara, a real 3 star hotel, for 49.99 a night, almost the same price I was paying for the Malibu Suites off the strip."
572,,"As a small business owner and trying to stay close to the strip in order to meet with clients, I chose Manor Suites because of the price for the lengthy stay. The entire time I was there, the internet that they advertise as having, wasn't working. When I asked the front desk about it, they kept reponding to me with, &quot;the internet guy will be out tomorrow to fix it.&quot; They don't have a name for him, and I never saw him. Then after almost 5 days of not having any internet access, I called down on a friday afternoon and asked if they planned on fixing it, and I was told that the, &quot;Internet Guy,&quot; doesn't work on the weekend, so he would be out on Monday. I checked out the following Thursday and still had no internet. I had to drive to other places around town just to get any internet service. It was NOT worth the stay if you plan on ever checking your email while in Las Vegas. The worst service ever. I wish that when I showed up they would have told me that for the next few weeks I wouldn't have any way to do business over a computer. But then they wouldn't have my money."
573,,"I just returned from staying at this hotel and continue to think this is the best hotel in all of Las Vegas. I stay here several times a year and love the fact that there is no casino, no smoking and the rooms are in fabulous condition, not to mention the service is awesome and genuine (unlike gaming hotels). If you are looking for a comfortable, quiet and safe hotel, this is it. I dislike the &quot;big box&quot; hotels because they are difficult to navigate, stink of smoke, are noisy (especially when the drunks return to their rooms at 3am) and are far too expensive. This is the best hotel!"
574,,Great place and a good position next to the strip. The only problem we incountered is that in the morning starting at 7am the valet staff and the people parking their car there have to blow their horn as the move through the parking garage. This continues until 2pm making it impossible to sleep. I'm not sure why they need to keep blowing the car horns all morning long but they need to find a different way.
575,,"it was amazing... vegas was amazing.. meridian means luxury.. meridian means your home at vegas.. i really loved it we stay 3 days at Meridian and ? sware ? could cry while leaving...?t was may vegas home and ? really want to stay there again,again,again :)"
576,,"Really nice place- very new, sleek, clean. Awesome free breakfast. Polite staff. No complaints."
577,,"I booked a 3 bed suite 2 weeks in advance with a confirmed reservation at a price quoted both by a clerk at the property on the phone and the internet. When I arrived the price had magically risen about 20%. No managers were available and the clerk insisted I must have been mistaken: &quot;we never quote that price&quot; even though she acknowledged my rate was on the internet. Next time, get a faxed confirm or better yet, stay away. This is not your typical franchise owned Motel 6 and operates way below their standards.No cups, ice, bath towels, toiletries or morning coffee was provided. No temp control on AC. Back rooms are on street and loud. Despite a large billboard on top claiming ESPN &amp; HBO, they're not there and the TV reception verges on useless. The room interiors are crude from one too many renovations and I have my doubts about how clean they are.TRY ANOTHER!!! THIS ONE ISN'T WORTH IT."
578,,"My wife and I were going to stay here for the night, on our way to my brother's house. It took the rude woman at the desk several minutes to notice us, and looked like she had NO IDEA WHATSOEVER what she was doing. We got to our room, and it felt, sounded, and smelled like a thousand rats were living in the walls and floor. The sheets were stained with bodily waste and cigarette burns, and whether you believe me or not, I even found a pistol under the bed. VERY SEEDY! Due to the horrible state of the bed, (bedbugs and loose springs), I was up until midnight, so I looked out the window, and while I am not sure, I could have sworn I saw people making drug deals in the parking lot! Like I said, VERY SEEDY. Give it a miss."
579,,"The funny thing was that I was trying to reserve a room at the Hampton Inn. But because of my indecisiveness the rate at the Hampton Inn more than doubled and so this was the only other option left.I have never seen so much activity in a hotel parking lot. Car stereos blaring hiphop music, people running, people yelling. It was unreal. I thought the only natural thing to happen next was for the cops to arrive.The room was absolutely disgusting. The nonsmoking room reaked of cigarettes. The carpet and the sheets were soiled. Towels were not white but rather had a tint of yellow or light brown. There were cigarette burns on the pillowcase and along the edges of the bathroom sink. It was hard to sleep with all the bass booming through the paper thin walls.Take it from me. Please don't stay here. You'll be glad you didn't."
580,,"Have just got back from a holiday in the USA and visited Las Vegas when I was there. The motel was within walking distance of the Strip, and the room that I was in looked lke it had been recently renovated and was very nice."
581,,"This was a great hotel . It was quiet and the location is even kind of quiet with not too many cars and their noise. It is across the street from the El Cortez which is also owned by Jackie Gaughan; the chinese buffet is pretty good. The bus stopped not too far from the hotel even after midnight when I arrived. It only cost my $1.25 from the McCarran. I was really happy all the way around with the trip , it was my 6th trip to Vegas. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone ! Gambling is only a walk across the street to the El Cortez."
582,,"Our stay at the Palace Station was great. We stayed in the tower and a amazing view right down the strip. All our requests were seen to immediately. Other than the resort fee there were no added charges. We ate at the Breakfast Buffet, Cabo and Coco's. The food was very good. The buffet had just about anything you could want for breakfast, with a made to order egg station. The casino cocktail waitresses came around very frequently and were friendly. The property had a very &quot;safe&quot; feeling to it. The Starbucks in the lobby opened at 6:00am and closed at midnight. The shuttles to the strip and airport were right on time. All in all we had a Great Experience at the Palace Station."
583,,"We had a 90 minute wait for our room, despite showing up after check in time. Fair enough, this can happen. The front desk was vague on the hotel's amenities and offerings. After getting no call about the room, I went to inquire and surprisingly the room was now free. We were offered bell service with our luggage, and after waiting one hour and 2 calls to the desk, we finally received our luggage. We got a 1 bedroom suite and it was spacious and well appointed. The supposed VIP passes to clubs is a farce. We had to pay for a VIP pass to all clubs, whereas with Caeser's and other big hotels, they look after guests with free entry into their clubs. The people attending the clubs are young and trashy, no sense of style, dress wise or dancing wise. You could find this type of club anywhere in outback AUS or USA. The pool is quite small and just has people lounging around drinking cans of beer and smoking in the pool. Yuck!This is the first time we have stayed off the strip in Vegas, and won't do it again. The strip is where it is happening and you get a better class of guests in the bigger hotels.Disappointed in the Palms Place, it lacked service and professionalism, and seemed to be run on skeleton staff."
584,,"First of all, we had a lock off room with a kitchenette and that's never a good idea. Second, we own at the Marriott Grand Chateau next door which is WORLD's better, but wasn't quite finished when we made this trip and our week was a free comp from Marriott for our timeshare purchase. The room was very average and small, but that's because it was the lock off room. It is in a good location, just right off the strip and we only rarely drove or used a cab to get to anything. Service was average at best. Whenever we asked for something it took a while and often, multiple calls, to get what we wanted or needed. You need to know that with most timeshares, check out is 10am and since we didn't get in until 4am the morning we were supposed to check out, we negotiated an additional 2 or 3 hours for an extra $45. We needed the sleep and check out at noon or 1pm was a much better idea. Alas, the front desk called at 9am to verify that we were going to be checking out late. And woke us up. And yes, I was not very pleasant. Then, just as we drifted back off...housekeeping started cleaning the connected room very loudly and then knocked on our door repeatedly and then tried to get in. By the time I pulled the door open, the cleaning lady was running down the hallway, because she realized she'd made a mistake. Not her fault. She wasn't told not to clean our room, but should've been told. I wanted to argue about the $45, but my wife wisely suggested I go get the car and find my peace and she checked us out. Better to write off the money and enjoy the rest of the day. So...my experience was sub-par, but I'd say overall the Polo Towers is a very average hotel and I feel for anyone who buys here with something as nice as the Grand Chateau next door. Oh, and even if you don't stay here (which you shouldn't), check out the three horse sculpture in the lobby. There's something really wrong about it and I think all three horses that posed for the sculpture are going to need some counseling. I'm just saying, it looks...well, it looks wrong. That's all."
585,,The room was clean and served its purpose. Definately no frills kind of place. Not very plush and the Casino was kind of dull. The roller coasters are the coolest feature.
586,,"We got a great deal on the Red Rock so decided to go for the weekend. The resort was about 20 minutes from the strip but we drove down so it wasn't a big deal. It was very quiet and not a lot going on, which was nice. Not too much smoke, not too crowded, not too loud, perfect. T-bones was phenomenal, one of the top 3 steaks we've ever had and we've had some damn good steaks! The mattress left a lot to be desired, not sure if we got a bad one but it had two large craters in it didn't complain because we didn't want to move for one night. Also, the views were less than impressive after looking at their website. The mountains, were more like ant hills and I didn't see the strip view but it was quite a ways away. I am a bit spoiled though I have views of Mount Olympus out my front door and 180 degree views of the Salt Lake valley out the back. The pool was wonderful as was the room and lobby!"
587,,"We stayed for one night while in Vegas. Parking is free, as is valet. Check-in was great and the staff from start to finish were extremely helpful and nice. Any issues we had were attended to immediately. Our room was gorgeous and very clean. The bathroom had a separate glass shower and soaking tub. The bed was oh so comfy! This hotel is not directly on the strip, but the staff can arrange a cab or other transportation at the drop of a hat. It is right next to the convention center in the event that you would need to be close to it. The internet was not free (I believe $12/night or so). If we go back, we would definitely stay again."
588,,"My husband and I have not been to vegas for a while (i'm talking about several years) and I thought of surprising him by booking a getaway to vegas for our valentines. This hotel is a perfect place to stay and I'll tell you why...my husband and I got sick by the time we got to vegas.( I know ..really suckkedd esp when it was a valentine's weekend) He came down with severe cold and flu and so did I. On our first night, we checked in at 9pm and the front desk guy was a very nice man. We were having small talk and in that talk we asked for the nearest walgreens and also some good restaurants for delivery. Not only he gave us the directions to the store, he also recommend this good &amp; cheap chinese rest. The next morning I called up the front desk and asked if I could take the breakfast back to my room since my husband wasn't feeling too well...and the guy said it was fine..I have been to plenty of hotels and sometimes they have problems bringing meals back to your room but not this place. After feeling ok after a day or so, we decided to go out to the strip... We had the same guy who helped us check in, get us a cab..to my husband any my surprise, he remembered us being sick and asked how we were feeling and if everything was ok..I was simply amazed..In a busy city like vegas...who remembers who but not this guy..This is my main reason to go back and stay here again.. Few other things:Nice location: You get ur privacy..and still feel like ur in vegasFriendly staff: We asked to extra blankets &amp; towels and immediately got them. Front desk ee's was so pleasant!Room: Nice , big studio room. They has kitchen so you can make your own coffee,tea and even warm up your dinner..fridge and dish washerParkng: FREE!!!Overall: LOVED IT!!!! We are very simple,easy going and very private couple and this place was beyond my expectation..We will definitely stay here again in future.. BIG THANKS TO JUSTIN (Front desk guy :)"
589,,"I Have been for the first time to Lasvegas .We had reservation from Priceline.I have always had good results with priceline and will continue to use them. This property was clean and the grounds were well maintained.The rooms were clean,food was very good, Nice things about this hotel is it comes with a complimentary internet and breakfast which was of high class. I will surely stay here when I go to Vegas again and will also recommend this to my friends. A complete and satisfactory stay indeed.We also loved the secure parking lot and convenient location."
590,,"outdated room, major reduction in free food for the evening"
591,,Stayed at the RIO for 5 days. Rooms are looking a little worn. Room almost clean. Huge Room. Decent for the price we payed. Don't expect top notch. Wasn't as nice as what we heard about it. Noisy (Go car racing in the parking lot started at 8AM daily.) Good Buffet. After staying at the Signature @ MGM it's hard to stay anywhere else. Decent value for your $$$.
592,,"We stayed in the Monoco Tower. The room was large and very clean and comfortable. On a par with several other hotel/casinos I have stayed at for business up and down the strip. The Riviera was HALF the price, even with good discounts at the other places (the company I worked for bought a block of 300-plus rooms). Bathroom perhaps a bit smaller than the typical, but still very functional. Food: Two great buys at the hotel. 1.) The best food buy on the strip is breakfast in the food court. A 3-egg omelet, 3 strips of bacon, hash brown triangle, toast AND orange juice or coffee for $5.50. Served until 11 a.m. 2.) Go to Katy's and order one of the &quot;deli-style&quot; sandwiches for around $9. Deli-style means it going to be about 5 inches high. Split it between 2 people and you're eating for about $6 each, including 2 drinks, and it's plenty of food.Ambiance: Only downer for us was that the pool is outside only and was closed. If you're looking for the latest high-intensity, ultra-vibrant, &quot;happening&quot; place then the Riviera probably isn't for you. If you want a very nice room on the strip at a very sane price, I don't think you can beat it. Our room was in Monaco Tower and had a small refrigerator. No electric &quot;surcharge&quot; with our prepay arrangements. We only used our cell phone. Staff was helpful and friendly. You may wait in line to register--but you do that everywhere on the strip unless you're a VIP of some sort with a lot of cash to waste. Once again, we found the Riv to be a great value!"
83148,,"fro, which days are you taking off for the holidays?  i don't think i asked you if you were going to visit your parents (you are right)? it's so weird having Christmas Day and New Years Day smack in the middle of the workweek - i can't decide which days to take off."
83149,,"I want one!! but can't...  I was just going to share about my Icebreakers power trip experience. I opened my Ice Breakers can to reach for a mint just now, you know, the round tin kind that has a plastic flappy lid that snaps shut? the force of opening the snappy lid caused the remnant (cause i am a mint fiend and pop mints nonstop all day) mints to shudder. the Ice breaker mints if you are familiar with them are shaped like little pills, but are curved in a satisfying manner towards the center, so they were wobbling in there looking like they were shuddering. here is my power trip, this is me -> "" Ha ha, I am the giant traumatizing the little mint community, which mint shall be eaten this time!?!"" all the while, the mints are shuddering in fear. (or shuddering in laughter at my insane imagination ;p)"

83165,,"ro is right,  crumpets are not scones, sorry about that...   urlLink  crumpets    [KRUHM-piht] Hailing from the British Isles, crumpets are small, yeast-raised breads about the size of an English muffin. The unsweetened batter is poured into special crumpet rings  (which have been arranged on a griddle), then ""baked"" on stovetop. The finished crumpet has a smooth, brown bottom and a top riddled with tiny holes. Crumpets are toasted whole (unlike ENGLISH MUFFINS, which are split) and spread with butter and jam, as desired.    English muffin  This round, rather flat (about 3 inches in diameter by 1 inch high) ""muffin"" is made from a soft yeast dough that, after being formed into rounds, is baked on a griddle. It can be made at home but is readily available commercially in an assortment of flavors including sourdough, whole wheat, raisin, cinnamon and cornmeal. English muffins are halved before toasting. In order to produce a surface with the proper peaks and craters (which adds to their crunchy texture and provides plentiful pockets for butter and jam), English muffins must be fork-split and gently pulled apart. Using a knife to cut them in half will not produce the desired result.    scone  [SKOHN; SKON] This Scottish QUICK BREAD is said to have taken its name from the Stone of Destiny (or Scone), the place where Scottish kings were once crowned. The original triangular-shaped scone was made with oats and griddle-baked. Today's versions are more often flour-based and baked in the oven. They come in various shapes including triangles, rounds, squares and diamonds. Scones can be savory or sweet and are usually eaten for breakfast or tea.   biscuit  [BIHS-kiht] 1. In America, biscuits refer to small QUICK BREADS, which often use LEAVENERS like baking powder or baking soda. Biscuits are generally savory (but can be sweet), and the texture should be tender and light. 2. In the British Isles, the term ""biscuit"" usually refers to a flat, thin cookie or cracker. 3. The word biscuit comes from the French bis cuit  (""twice cooked""), which is what the original sea biscuits aboard ship had to be in order to remain crisp."

83178,,"enough enough!! my defense for LOTR2 -  the whole movie was filmed as one whole big thing. with the vast scope of the book and the entire anthropology of different characters Tolkien created, it was next to impossible to give justice to the whole book and each creature. i heard that they had to cut out a ton of stuff already, so let's watch the directer's cut before we really criticize.  (i do have beef with the story changes they made with the elks, the Rohanian war and so on...)  ... i think i was just disappointed cause it wasn't what i thought it would be, not even that the first one was so great, but it just didn't satisfy what i had created in my head while reading the books. but i still love it! (can i stress that more?)   I LOVE LOTR's  p.s.  whodo!!! read the book!!!"
83179,,"LOTR-2  OK.  I wasn't going to get into specifics, but.. [** STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!] The beef i had was: -  The pacing.  It was  distractingly off  in many places.  In a few scenes i was just like, hello, there's an army of 10,000 killers right outside the door, where is there time to be talking so slowly and just  being cool ? - The way the editing was done, there wasn't much  progression  or a real  climax  either.  The beginning was SO dark and evil (almost too real, it was very well done) and everything seemed so hopeless, but the resolution (the ending) just wasn't done well enough, that it seemed like too much of a cop out: it's like, *bling,* the elves show up, and *bling,* the big tree people show up, and *woah* where did that dam come from ? -- positioned in the perfect place and with enough water to flush out all the bad guys.  - and lastly, the comic relief was kind of random (gollum was a bit overdone, no? and gimli's character was reduced to being there  only  for that purpose.)   ok, if I sound all cynical and harsh, sorry.  And it sounds like i'm ripping it to shreds, when it really wasn't  bad  - it's probably just that i went in with  big  expectations  (LOTR1 was SO well done!!)   Also, I'm sure it's a very different experience for those who've read the books and know all the background and all kinds of details than for someone like me who {*gasp*} haven't read them.  But anyway, a movie should stand on its own.   ...We were saying how 1 and 3 will probably be best, and 2 is kind of the middle filler.  btw, i wonder if the same group of people did the editing for 1 as for 2..?  does anyone know? **and oh yeah, i don't have to even say that all the special effects were totally AMAZING.  They were the best part.."

LOTR2 feels like the seams to a really pretty garment, unfortunately, the seams are just not as pretty as other parts of the garment, know what I mean? it still was darn good, but compared to the 1st one... well, it's just a little scatty like. I still love LOTR though. ... family traits ?!?! hmmm... we are all stubborn, we are all uber-sensitive, so we all argue a lot. my mom and my dad are such different people, I have no idea how they got together in the first place.  my dad is a couch po-tay-toe, and my mom wakes up at 4.30 to walk the dogs.  we (my sister, my bro and i) we're couch pototoes at heart, so we like lounging and eating, funny thing is, we're all pretty much kinda athletic when we need to be. we were all on the swim team, track, all sorts of stuff like that... but then we were all groomed and grown under the asian mentality of putting your children in all the classes under the sun, so i went to ballet, math tutoring, piano, violin, swimming, riding (horses that is), tennis, painting, countless countless things... one thing about the ho family, we all love to eat. we know our foods, and just let me tell you, we like to eat  well .  we also love travelling in a big circus fashion, and we travel to bask in the sun and to eat good food. we have restaurant guides of most major cities on this planet, my dad even suggested going to India for curry and would have went if it were not for the political unrest in all the neighbouring countries. we're funny like that, we would do all sorts of crazy things for food. we also love boardgames, and trash talking during boardgames, so i do that a lot...  all our weekends are spent at the pool and when it's winter, we go to an indoor pool, we're all chlorine heads, but now that we have dogs, we do much less of that. I grew up eating chicken drumsticks next to the slippy slide at the country club pool, (yes I'm a brat, what can i say?) and playing table tennis or badminton on the grass.  my bro and i are the most similar, we're both big babies and I can practically read his mind, which freaks him out (i really enjoy it). (he's 9 years my junior btw, he's my own little punk :p) that's all for now, i think i was just rambling on about what we do, I don't know if these things qualify as traits or not, but there are 5 of us altogether, so it's hard to have traits... we're all wierd and different."

83185,,"herro ebreebodee.   assignment 18.  ok, where to start.  My family's very funny.  No, really.   The thing i was thinking about that got me even started on this was, when we were growing up, i guess partly because of the korean-english language barrier, i could never expect anything i said to my mom to be heard and understood the first time.  It would take 2 or 3 times.  Every single thing I said.   But my mom's english is actually pretty fluent.  Most of the reason is the  family trait  of a.d.d.-like zoning out.  Total Immersion in deeep thoughts.  My brother's the same way.  I'll ask him a direct, simple question.  He'll just sit there for like a minute, i'll repeat myself (and be more direct if possible), and  then  he'll sort of start, shake off his thoughts, and look around a little... ""Oh! huh? what?""  and then if i'm lucky he'll answer me.  (If this sounds like it might get frustrating after a while, it is.. sometimes it got so ridiculous i just had to laugh.  Of course, this is just their default state - they do have times of normal alertness and all, and it's a great treat to be engaged in conversation with them in those times.) Have  I  inherited it?  Um, yeah i'll confess to being more-than-average zone-out-ish.  And I do love those times alone to just think.  But yo, not like that.  Not quite the way mom and bro do it.  There's some intense daydreaming power running in my family...  maybe it could be used for something?  powering the house ?...   :P  Something my bro and i share, which is pretty surprising for him, considering his personality - is a tendency to be super thorough.  In anything he cares about, he'll stress over it and chew his thumb cuticle (which i do!  and my mom too, when we get nervous that's our telltale sign).  I've been learning to be more of a broad brush-stroker with some things..  I guess just with the coming time off with family and all, I was just thinking about these things, and wondering about your families. So...any quirky family traits  pour vous ?  {c'mon, fess up ;P}"

839,,(CNN)Liverpool lost its first Premier League home game in almost four years as relegation-threatened Burnley pulled off a stunning upset to end Jurgen Klopp's 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield.Ashley Barnes' penalty six minutes from time secured a famous win -- Burnley's first at Anfield in 46 years -- and piled yet more pressure on an out of sorts Liverpool side that has now failed to score a goal in the league for seven hours and 18 minutes.It's the first time in 21 years that Liverpool has failed to find the net in four consecutive Premier League games, with the Reds now in fourth place and six points adrift of league leader Manchester United.The pressure also appears to be getting to Klopp, who was visibly furious during an exchange with Burnley manager Sean Dyche in the tunnel at the end of the first half."The game was impossible to lose, but we did," Klopp told Sky Sports after the game. "That's my fault because it's my job to make sure the boys have the right feelings, the right amount of confidence and make the right decisions.Read MoreLiverpool suffered its first home defeat since April 2017."That obviously didn't work out because we had the ball a lot, created some situations that were OK, but in the final moment our decision-making is not right at the moment, and that's the problem."It's always my fault, the things that don't work are my fault, the things that do work are down to the players. Credit to the players because it's what they make of it."Interestingly, Burnley was the only side to manage a single point at Anfield last season during Liverpool's title-winning romp. However, Dyche's side has struggled this season and has so far been mired in a relegation battle.But in Thursday's victory, Burnley was back to its gritty and defensive best, limiting Liverpool to not even a handful of chances over the course of the game. An early error from Ben Mee gifted Divock Origi with a glorious chance to give Liverpool the lead at the end of the first half, but the Belgian's shot struck the underside of the crossbar.There were few chances of note in the second half, with Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope confidently saving any effort that did squeeze through a resolute back line.In the end, it was a clumsy challenge from goalkeeper Alisson on Barnes that gifted the English forward with the chance to earn all three points from the penalty spot and inflict Liverpool's first home defeat since a loss to Crystal Palace in April 2017.Ashley Barnes' late penalty secured three crucial points for Burnley.The victory will have certainly eased those relegation fears, with Burnley climbing above Brighton into 16th and putting seven points between itself and the relegation zone."I think we did the basics very well," Dyche told Sky Sports after the match. "The structure of the side, shape of the side, individual diligence. Players doing their jobs when they had to. We still needed a bit of luck; Nick Pope has made a good save to his left in the second half."You are never comfortable, but I have been in the game a long time and you can see the patterns of a game sometimes. The only worry was if a block landed to one of their players or something goes against you. It didn't feel like that type of a game against a top side."It was the will and desire from the defenders and the goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet and the work rate of the two forwards as well. You cannot just defend from the back four, you have to defend from the whole side, and I think everyone did that well."
840,,(CNN)Sports stars often talk about being in the "zone," that mythical place where good things happen.For Formula E driver Sam Bird, his "zone" moment came in what he calls the "race of my life" in Buenos Aires in 2016.The Briton led from the start and says he was at one with his car, although he described the experience as "intense" as he fended off a phalanx of challengers to clinch his first victory that season."Going through the final chicane of every single lap I just needed to show the front of the car the corner and the car was turning for me," he told CNN's Supercharged TV show. "I don't think I ever really needed to do too much steering input, I just played with the rear like a rally car for 30 odd laps. It was really, really intense." Read MoreREAD: 'Movement, vibration, dynamism': The helmet-cam that is revolutionizing Formula EBird celebrates at the podium after winning the Buenos Aires ePrix.From winning on his hometown track in London in 2015 to crashing out in Mexico City earlier this year, the 30-year-old Bird has experienced nearly everything possible on the track. But that race in the Argentine capital, the fourth event of Formula E's second season, gave Bird a much-needed boost after a sluggish start to the campaign.He blitzed through qualifying to sit on pole before launching his blistering burst. "I think I'd eaten my Weetabix that morning and I was able to secure pole position and then it really was the race of my life," Bird added.Bird certainly did not have an easy ride, having to fend off the advances of both Lucas di Grassi and eventual Championship winner Sebastian Buemi during the race. "I think I always had a car within half a second of the back of my car," he remembers. "I had Di Grassi breathing down my neck for most of the race and then Buemi came right from the back all the way to the front to put me under pressure."Bird (right) leads Nicolas Prost and Antonio Felix de Costa during the Buenos Aires ePrix.Bird remained cool despite the heat behind and took advantage of FanBoost -- an opportunity for fans to vote for their favorite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race -- to finish 0.716 seconds ahead of Buemi and claim his third career Formula E win."It was probably the hardest I've ever had to work in a single seater car, and I could not wait to see the chequered flag," added Bird, who is one of only four drivers to race for the same team for all six Formula E seasons alongside di Grassi, Oliver Turvey and Buemi. "Honestly, that podium felt amazing. To get the first win for DS was a really, really big moment for us as a team and something I'll cherish for a long time." Bird celebrates his win.While it was Virgin Racing's second season in the sport, it was its first season paired with the manufacturer DS Performance.And Bird believes his wild ride in Buenos Aires helped put the company on the map in its debut season. "DS had just joined Virgin Racing so they had just become a manufactured team and we had this new powerchain but it was really, really heavy, really over weight, super tricky to drive but we managed to win the race," he said.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIn total, Bird has finished on the podium 18 times in his 62 races for Virgin, winning nine of them.
841,,(CNN)Rising tennis star Paula Badosa announced on Thursday that she has tested positive for Covid-19 -- the first known Australian Open player to contract the virus.The 23-year-old Spaniard is among dozens of players now quarantining in Melbourne ahead of the Grand Slam event next month. "I have some bad news. Today I received a positive Covid-19 test result. I'm feeling unwell and have some symptoms, but I'll try to recover as soon as possible listening to the doctors. I've been taken to a health hotel to self-isolate and be monitored," Badosa posted on Twitter, thanking her supporters. A number of competing players had generated public anger in Australia after they expressed frustration at being kept in quarantine ahead of the first grand slam of the tennis season.In what appeared to be a reference to the backlash, Badosa added in a separate post afterward, "quarantine & preventive measures are pivotal right now. I talked about rules that changed overnight but I understand the sad situation we are living. Sorry guys."Spain's Paula Badosa reacts playing at the 2020 French Open in Paris on October 3, 2020.Read MorePrior to testing positive, Badosa was isolating under a mandatory 14-day quarantine rule. She is ranked No. 67 in the world and has competed in two Australian Opens. She most notably reached the round-of-16 at last year's French Open.Players arriving in the Australian state of Victoria have been placed into a 14-day quarantine ahead of their grand slam matches. Most have been allotted five hours each day to go out and train in strict bio-secure bubbles, but 72 players have been unable to leave their hotel rooms and cannot practice, under strict quarantine rules after passengers on their flights tested positive for Covid-19.At least seven confirmed cases, including non-playing participants, have been linked to the tournament, according to the state government of Victoria, where Melbourne is located.Australian Open: Quarantining tennis players voice 'unequal practice' frustrationsMelbourne, the second-most populous city in Australia, was under a hard lockdown for 111 days last year. Residents contended with a curfew, closures of businesses, bans on leaving their homes, online schooling and job losses. Some Melbourne residents have expressed concerns about the tournament's impact on the community. Many are worried restrictions could be reimposed if the virus -- particularly new, potentially more transmissible variants -- managed to get into the population because of the tournament.The Australian Open is scheduled to start on February 8, three weeks after its original start date. The government has allowed for 1,270 foreigners to enter the country to participate in the event, in the face of some of the world's most stringent arrival policies.
842,,(CNN)Confronting new, more transmissible variants of the coronavirus and a winter spike in infections, a number of European countries are beginning to make medical-grade face masks mandatory in the hope that they can slow the spread of the disease.The French government has now mandated that citizens wear single-use surgical FFP1 masks, more protective FFP2 filtering facepiece respirators or fabric masks which meet the same "Category 1" specifications -- blocking more than 90% of particles -- in all public places. In layman's terms, homemade masks will no longer cut it.  It follows a decision by the German government on Tuesday requiring all people to wear either FFP1 or FFP2 masks while on public transport, in workplaces and in shops. The move came after the German state of Bavaria introduced an even more stringent measure: Enforcing surgical grade N95 respirators, which filter 95% of air particles, in stores and on public transport. Austria will introduce its own FFP2 mandate on public transport and in shops from January 25.German Chancellor Angela Merkel cited the spread of new coronavirus variants, which were first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, as the reason for stricter requirements. "I urge people to take this seriously. Otherwise it is difficult to prevent a third wave," Merkel told journalists in Berlin on Thursday, adding that a video summit of European Union leaders would be focused squarely on ways to counter the spread of variants on the continent. Read MoreDuring the Thursday summit, EU leaders weighed tougher border restrictions to limit non-essential travel and agreed to a common framework for rapid testing, but mask-wearing was not discussed.The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) warned Thursday that new variants of the coronavirus could cause more hospitalizations and deaths across Europe, urging countries to start taking extra measures -- from physical distancing, to quarantining and contact tracing -- immediately. The ECDC currently recommends face masks in indoor and outdoor situations when physical distancing cannot be guaranteed, but does not specify what type of face covering should be used.London's ICU nurses detail 'diluted' care, depression and disaster during the UK's deadly second waveMeanwhile, in Britain, where a highly-contagious coronavirus mutation is driving a deadly third wave of the virus, medical-grade masks have not been mandated in public. Instead, face coverings are required on public transport, in shops and in other indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult.In the UK government's Covid guidance, scarves and bandanas are considered to be appropriate face coverings, despite evidence they do not effectively block respiratory droplets emitted by the wearer.Faced with more transmissible variants, some scientists say that the focus should be on limiting the amount of viral aerosol exposure as much as possible -- and recent studies suggest the best way to do that is through medical-grade masks, in addition to other public health measures.Unlike fabric and surgical masks, which protect other people from larger respiratory droplets emitted when speaking, coughing or sneezing -- in other words, outflowing air -- FFP masks protect the wearer by filtering both the outflow and inflow of air. They can also provide some level of protection against smaller droplets, or aerosols. When fitted correctly, FFP2 masks can filter at least 94% of particles.A sign mandating mask-wearing in the city of Fuerstenfeldbruck, southern Germany.A woman wearing an FFP2 face mask walks past a shuttered cafe in Berlin, Germany.And while the tight weave of surgical masks offer a high level of outflowing protection -- which is why they're used by medical professionals around patients -- cloth masks are more hit or miss. Their efficacy depends on the number of layers of fabric and the type of fabric used -- most don't have any sort of safety rating. Guidance on cloth masks, issued during the first wave of the pandemic when less was known about how Covid-19 could spread through aerosols and supplies of medical-grade masks were precarious, are now being reassessed. The new recommendations in Europe come after supplies of medical masks have increased, following initial fears there wouldn't be enough for frontline workers. But there are still questions over supply chain disruptions. Cloth masks are still considered to be better than wearing no mask at all, but France's health advisory council on Monday argued they may not offer sufficient protection against new variants."We are not questioning the masks used up to now ... but as we don't have any new weapons against the new strains, the only thing we can do is to improve the weapons we already have," Daniel Camus, a member of the council, told France's public broadcaster.There is some scientific evidence that medical-grade masks offer more protection and can help prevent the spread of the virus. People wearing face masks in Rennes, western France.A study published in the Lancet medical journal in June comparing transmission rates across 16 countries found that N95s and other respirator-type masks might give greater protection from viral transmission than surgical or multi-layered cotton masks.And another study released in August by Duke University, which compared the efficacy of 14 commonly available face coverings, found that the most effective was the fitted N95, followed by three-layer surgical masks. Neck fleeces, folded bandanas and knitted masks did not offer much protection, and in the case of the neck fleeces, also called gaiter masks, actually increased the transmission of respiratory droplets.Still, current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that medical or surgical masks should only be worn by healthcare workers, people with Covid-19 symptoms, those coming into contact with them, anyone aged 60 or over, as well as people with underlying medical conditions.The WHO recommends that the general population use fabric masks, ideally with three layers.But for European politicians scrambling to prevent a fresh surge of coronavirus cases from spiraling, the calculation is simple: If medical-grade masks will help stymie the spread of the virus, they should be enforced."We also want to make everyday life safer," Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder said last week, announcing the new mask rule.CNN's James Frater, Pierre Bairan, Claudia Otto and Inke Kappeler contributed to this report.

844,,(CNN)This year has not started well for Real Madrid. The Spanish giant was booted out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday after a humiliating defeat to third-division club Alcoyano.Zinedine Zidane's side had taken the lead through Eder Militao late in the first half but was forced into extra time by a late goal from Jose Solbes. Incredibly, the minnows even had a player sent off before Juanan volleyed home from close range to secure a famous win for the Segunda Division B outfit. Spanish newspaper AS called Wednesday's match "one of the most red-faced pages of its [Madrid's] history."Read MoreSpeaking after the match, Zidane took responsibility for the defeat but rubbished claims the result was an embarrassment."It's not an embarrassment, it's something that can always happen in football," he told reporters."Something like this can happen in a footballer's career but I take responsibility for it and we'll keep on working. We're not going to go crazy over this."Zidane had made multiple changes to his starting lineup but threw on a host of world-class substitutions in order to save the game late on. But even the likes of Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema couldn't save the day as Madrid was left reflecting on its worst cup result since losing to the then third-division side Alcorcon in 2009."You should always dream big, we worked our socks off and suffered a lot," said Alcoyano keeper Jose Juan after the match.

845,,(CNN)We are all better after a decent night's sleep -- and insects are no different.But two new studies have found a commonly used pesticide is disrupting the sleep of bees and flies -- with big consequences for the important insects.In one study, researchers looked at the effect of pesticides on bumblebee behavior by giving the creatures nectar sugar laced with neonicotinoids -- one of the most commonly used pesticides -- and then tracking their movements in a foraging arena.The impact of the pesticide -- similar to the amount a bee would encounter in the wild -- was stark. "It seems to disrupt the body clock in foraging bumblebees -- they forage much less, more of that foraging is happening at nighttime, and they are sleeping a lot more in the daytime. It's causing a mistiming of their normal behaviors," Kiah Tasman, teaching associate at the University of Bristol's School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, told CNN.Read MoreThis, she explained, could have serious implications: "It's quite worrying because other studies and our studies show that the foraging motivation has decreased."2020 was the year of scary bugs, and 2021 will be even worseMany plants -- including the fruit and vegetables that we eat and feed to our livestock -- rely on pollinators, like bees, to reproduce. Almost 90% of wild plants and 75% of leading global crops depend on animal pollination, the World Wildlife Fund notes. Bees take on a big share of this workload: Pollinators, most often honey bees, are responsible for one in every three bites of food we take, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, and increase crop values in the US by more than $15 billion each year.But bees and other pollinators are under threat because of widespread pesticide use, habitat loss, the climate crisis and parasites, so much so that the odds of spotting the hardworking bumblebee in Europe and America are down by more than 30% since the last century.Tasman warned that bees are now "quite sluggish and they're going out less often anyway.""If the time where they are managing to go out and forage is at nighttime when flowers aren't available, that's going to hugely reduce how successful they are at collecting the food that the colony needs to grow and reproduce," Tasman, lead author of the studies, said.Pesticides damage the brains of baby bees, new research findsIt could also affect how well bees are able to care for their young, she said. Meanwhile, the same pesticides have already been found to damage the brains of baby bees. In a second study, published Thursday, the researchers focused their attention on flies -- again, exposing them to neonicotinoids, and then using infrared beams to monitor how this affected movement.  The results showed that the pesticide was working directly on the cells in the brain that run the body clock, which decide when sleep and activity happen in the day -- and confusing them."It looks like these pesticides freeze these cells in a daytime shape, so the body doesn't know if it's daytime or nighttime," Tasman said, adding that it is very likely that the same kind of mechanism happening in the flies is also happening in bees. Researchers say their studies can help us to further understand how these pesticides are affecting vulnerable insects."It also gives us hints on what we could investigate if we were to make more pest specific pesticides -- if we understand exactly how they are working in the insects, maybe we can make some that only work on pests," Tasman added.

Australian Open tennis stars get creative with practice while stuck in hotel quarantine"One of those is a player who we absolutely believe is shedding, but has anyway been in hard lockdown because he came in on one of the flights where we had positives," Neville said. "One is another player. One is a support person with that player."In the meantime, the player, the support person and their bubble so the other support person and player they're with will not be training until we have a final confirmation that they are shedding or that they are positive. If they are positive, those two will go onto a health hotel and the two bubble people will be considered close contacts and will be in lockdown for the 14 days."Viral shedding is the release of the virus from the body into the environment and can occur even if a person has tested negative for Covid-19.Preferential treatmentPlayers currently stuck in quarantine have been getting creative with ways to practice while confined to their hotel rooms, with some resorting to using their beds as makeshift hitting partners.However, normally accustomed to practicing on a court for several hours a day in the lead up to a grand slam, some players have suggested those who underwent quarantine will be at a physical disadvantage when the Australian Open starts on February 8.Daniel Vallverdu, coach of three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka, has proposed that the players who were stuck in their hotel rooms should receive preferential treatment when the tournament begins, including more practice time and matches at cooler times of the day.

"Once they come out of quarantine they're only going to have one or two days maximum to get on court before having their first match."So any extra days that they can get, and preference and some privileges when it comes to scheduling, I think would be more than fair and hopefully the rest of the playing field will feel the same. Scheduling, extra practice, preferential treatment when it comes to practice times, extra time on the court."Match scheduling, playing not in the sunny time of the day, they can play when it cools down a bit, they can get a late start for the tournament, the tournament can start one or two days later if possible."

A statement on his social media channels said the 45-year-old had experienced "discomfort" whilst playing at the PNC Championship in December and had had a successful "procedure to remove a pressurized disc fragment that was pinching his nerve."Whilst the statement did not give an exact return date, doctors are said to be confident the golf icon will make a full recovery. "I look forward to begin training and am focused on getting back out on Tour," said Woods, who is currently ranked 44th in the world.'He's not going to like this sh*t at all': Documentary shines new light on Tiger Woods' life He looks set to miss several PGA Tour events, including this month's Farmers Insurance Open and The Genesis Invitational in February.Read MoreHowever, the statement assured he would still fulfill his role as host of the latter.Woods last had back surgery -- a spinal fusion -- in 2017 and made his return almost a year later.

851,,Moscow (CNN)Even locked up in a detention center on the outskirts of Moscow, Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny continues to be a thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin's side.Late Tuesday, which marked the opposition leader's first day at the infamous Matrosskaya Tishina facility, his team dropped a colossal investigation into the President's wealth, offering Russians to take look into what they allege is "Putin's palace" on the Black Sea.Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) called the report their "biggest investigation yet." It contains allegations of vast corruption schemes related to what they say is Putin's property estimated to be worth around $1.4 billion. CNN is not independently able to verify the FBK's claims. Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the Russian leader was linked to the estate on Tuesday.Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny to be held in custody for 30 days following his return to Russia "They are repeating the old story. It was the year of 2017 or 2016, if I'm not mistaken, that the first time it was mentioned there should be the so-called palace of Putin in Gelendzhik. This is not true. There is no palace, he is not an owner of any palace," Peskov told CNN. Read More"Those are all rumors and there were some disputes between the owners of those premises but they really have no connection with President Putin."The existence of the property was first reported over a decade ago when a businessman Sergey Kolesnikov published an open letter with various documents urging then-President Dmitry Medvedev to "stop the corruption" that funds the construction of the alleged palace.The 17,691-square-meter castle features 11 bedrooms according to plans obtained by FBK.But Navalny's new investigation, which he says he thought of while getting treated at the Berlin Charite clinic, purports to show the scale of the estate and expose dubious financial schemes behind the grand project. The report and an almost two-hour-long documentary film also offer a more comprehensive look inside the palace. FBK says a subcontractor involved in construction handed over detailed plans of the building along with itemized lists of purchased furniture and samples of floor patterns. The group then used these documents and photos obtained from construction workers to create 3D-models of the interiors."This is like a state within a state where one irremovable czar rules," Navalny says in the documentary. "It is built in a way that no one can reach it by land, sea or air, thousands of people working there are banned from bringing even a simple cell phone with a camera... but we will take a look inside."According to the plans, the 17,691-square-meter castle features 11 bedrooms, several living rooms and dining halls, a private theater, a movie theater, a Las Vegas style casino, two spas and a hammam, a bakery, and a "dirt room" with an unknown purpose. The rooms, adorned with velvet and lush carpets, feature marble floors, columns, and intricate ceiling decorations made to resemble St. Petersburg royal palaces. The property on the Black Sea is estimated to be worth $1.4 billion, according to the FBK.A separate part of the report is dedicated to descriptions of staggeringly expensive furniture made to order by a luxury Italian brand, including a $56,000 table and a $27,000 sofa. Described on the FBK site as "the most controversial room in Putin's palace," the plan also features a hookah lounge with what appears to be a dancer's pole. As the Navalny site sarcastically states: "On the plan it is designated as a 'hookah room.' And all would be fine, but there is not a single window in that room, but for some reason there is a stage, a dressing room, spotlights, and something very similar to a pole drawn on the plan. We thought for a long time what it could be. Perhaps they make giant shawarmas there... Or it's a training ground for firefighters."Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation says the castle's costs have skyrocketed due to constant renovations, according to interviews with people who worked at the site. The house initially had critical issues with the ventilation system and humidity levels, which led to many rich interiors being destroyed due to mold, according to the FBK's probe.FBK says the property surrounding the palace itself is estimated to occupy 68 hectares but adds that the actual estate is likely about 100 times bigger, with a large adjacent plot of land that allegedly belongs to the Federal Security Service, or the FSB, as a buffer to the estate. According to the drone videos shot by FBK, the estate features a private hockey rink, personal church, amphitheater, and a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse. The territory is heavily guarded with multiple checkpoints leading up to it; the plot of land itself is listed as a no-fly zone, per FBK.According to drone videos shot by FBK, the estate features a private hockey rink, church, amphitheater, and a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse.The territory boasts sprawling vineyards where classical music is played around the clock, apparently to help the grapes mature, according to members of the vineyard association for the region who heard the music playing during a tour of the estate, the FBK says. Bathrooms at a processing facility in the vineyard are reportedly equipped with an $850 Italian toilet brush and a $1,250 toilet paper holder. Navalny claims that wine-making is Putin's "very expensive hobby" and the Russian President serves this wine to his friends: "He drinks it with his friend from China, Xi Jinping, and, under the same chardonnay, discusses 'deeper integration' with [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko," according to pictures of menus he says were served during official receptions.Navalny also claims to have uncovered a convoluted scheme to finance the property and other personal expenses of the President. The report claims that Putin, at the beginning of his presidency, struck a deal with Russian oligarchs and wealthy businessmen to "donate" some of their income to an investment firm. But 35% of those donations would then go to a special offshore Swiss bank account of a Belize-registered company, Navalny claims. Reuters previously reported on the financial web around the Black Sea property in 2014. Opinion: Why Putin wants to keep Navalny locked upNavalny, who was faced with the choice of fading into obscurity as an émigré or returning to Russia and being almost certainly jailed on arrival, chose the latter option. He was detained in a Moscow airport late Sunday moments after arriving from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from Novichok poisoning he blamed on the Russian government. The Kremlin repeatedly denied any involvement.The next morning Navalny faced an unexpected hearing where the judge ordered him to be placed in custody for 30 days. He now awaits trial to determine whether he violated the terms of his suspended sentence in a 2014 embezzlement case he says was politically motivated. Following the verdict on his detention, Navalny's team announced a nationwide demonstration this weekend, and the report is seen as a way to draw more Russians to the streets.The estate contains a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse according to drone videos shot by FBK."Most of all, I want that the same kind of anger that burns in me burns in the people who watch this video," Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh tweeted. "Putin is robbing my country, imprisoning my friends, he is a murderer. And I want to fight back. Moscow, Pushkin Square... I'll be there. I hope to see you there too."In less than a day, the documentary has eclipsed 25 million views on YouTube and is looking to overtake the report into the wealth of Medvedev, and Navalny's investigations into his own poisoning.The documentary showing Medvedev's mansion, among other things, was viewed more than 37 million times and led to several mass protests across Russia. At the time the Kremlin called calls for protest illegal and Medvedev dismissed the report as "nonsense." The demonstrations ended in mass detentions; in Moscow alone around 1,000 people were arrested. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.
852,,(CNN)Forty-three people died and 10 were rescued after a boat carrying West African migrants capsized off the Libyan coast on Tuesday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR said in a Wednesday statement.This is the first migrant shipwreck of the year 2021, the UNHCR said.The boat left the northwestern Libyan city of Zawya early Tuesday and reportedly capsized a few hours after departing due to bad sea conditions and when the engine stopped, the UNHCR said.Europe's migrant crisis is worsening during the pandemic.

853,,(CNN)Scientists have long wondered how butterflies fly -- compared with other flying animals, the creatures have unusually short, broad and large wings relative to their body size.Now, experts have found that the insects "clap" their wings together -- and their wings are perfectly evolved for better propulsion.Biologists from Sweden's Lund University set out to test a 50-year-old theory, that butterflies "clap" their wings together, pushing out the trapped air to create a jet and push the animal in the opposite direction. 'Critically endangered' monkey and armored slug among 503 new species named in 2020"Butterflies look different from many other flying animals, compared to birds and bats. They have a very extreme wing shape -- very large, short but very broad wings compared to their little body," Per Henningsson, associate professor in biology at Lund University, told CNN. "That is a bit of a puzzle, because that sort of wing is quite inefficient."       The biologists studied free-flying butterflies, and in their aerodynamic analysis, found the creatures' wings form a cupped shape during the upstroke and "clap," thrusting the butterfly forward. Meanwhile, the downstroke helps with weight support.Read MoreThey also noticed that the butterfly wings were behaving in an unusual way -- instead of slamming together, as two flat surfaces, the wings bent to create a "pocket shape," which would capture more air, and improve propulsion. "When the wings go up during the upstroke, and they clap together at the end of the upstroke, we saw that they were not just two flat surfaces," Henningsson explained.A second monarch butterfly conservationist has been found dead in Mexico"Instead they were bending, and due to their flexibility, (they were) forming a sort of pocket shape," he said, adding that the team thought that in doing so, butterflies captured more air between their wings, which improved the clap and boosted performance.The team tested their theory using a series of triangular robotic clappers, and found that flexible wings increased the  efficiency of the clap by 28% compared with rigid wingsExperts think the creatures may have evolved to favor this unusual wing shape in order to evade predators. "This flexibility might be one of the reasons they have this unusual wing shape," Henningsson said. "Butterflies take off very quickly -- they do this as a safety measure, to minimize risk of getting caught," he explained.The research was published Wednesday in the journal Interface.
854,,Sydney  (CNN)The quarantine controversy over tennis' Australian Open has raised questions about whether large-scale international sporting events can take place in the middle of a pandemic and could offer a preview of the difficulties facing this summer's Tokyo Olympics.Players arriving in the Australian state of Victoria have been placed into a 14-day quarantine ahead of their grand slam matches. Most have been allotted five hours each day to go out and train in strict bio-secure bubbles, but 72 players have been unable to leave their hotel rooms and cannot practice, under strict quarantine rules after passengers on their flights tested positive for Covid-19.Some tennis stars have expressed anger and frustration at being kept cooped up ahead of the first grand slam of the tennis season. They include record eight-time Australian Open men's singles winner Novak Djokovic, who put forward a list of proposals that would loosen the restrictions on the quarantining stars, including moving players to houses with courts, better food, and reducing the number of days in isolation. In response, Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said: "People area free to provide lists of demands, but the answer is no."Athletes have also raised concerns over whether those who can go out and train would have an unfair advantage over their competitors who have to isolate.Read MoreCanadian player Vasek Pospisil was a passenger on one of the three flights into Melbourne that had a handful of positive Covid-19 tests from those on board, meaning he is barred from going out to train during quarantine.He told CNN that the level of risk of an entire group on a flight having to undergo strict quarantine wasn't properly communicated to the players ahead of time, a claim Tennis Australia refutes. "All the players, we understood that if somebody tested positive that it would just be the group, like if somebody in your staff tested positive, then you would have to be quarantined; you wouldn't be able to practice. There wasn't any discussion about the whole plane going that way, so obviously it was a huge surprise to everybody," he said from his hotel room in Melbourne. But many Australians appear to have little sympathy for the athletes, many of whom have flown in from coronavirus hotspots to compete for a share of total prizes worth 71.5 million Australian dollars ($55.1 million).The Victoria state capital Melbourne, the second-most populous city in Australia, was under a hard lockdown for 111 days last year. Residents contended with a curfew, closures of businesses, bans on leaving their homes, online schooling and job losses. Some Melbourne residents expressed concerns about the impact on the community once the players have left post tournament. Many are worried restrictions could be reimposed if the virus -- particularly new, potentially more transmissible variants -- managed to get into the population because of the tournament. Serbia's Novak Djokovic stands on the balcony at his accommodation in Adelaide, Australia, on January 19, 2021. New cases linked to the tournamentOn Monday, Victoria reported four new Covid-19 cases, three of which are related to the Australian Open, according to the state government of Victoria. The number of people linked to the tournament that have  tested positive for the virus is now seven, after two cases were reclassified as "shedding," rather than being actively infected. Among the new cases are two unnamed players and one non-playing participant. "I think that the players are lacking perspective as they have been playing in countries where Covid is nuts," Melbourne resident and Grade 5 teacher Sarah Fuller told CNN. "Melbourne, after being through so much does not want any more restrictions or hard lockdowns due to the virus getting out. So for me, it just demonstrates a lack of understanding of where they are in the world and that it's a privilege to be able to play the game they do as their job."Like many people across the world, Fuller and her husband Trevor have had to navigate the struggles of extra hours working from home and keeping her students engaged in online learning through the pandemic. With family in another state, and the death of a grandparent, Fuller said it has been "exhausting."Fuller and her husband are avid tennis fans and usually buy tickets to the Australian Open. This year, the players, she said, are experiencing just a taste of the restrictions that herself and many others have lived under during the pandemic.Australian Open tennis stars get creative with practice while stuck in hotel quarantine"Yes it's difficult, it's not ideal and not normal, but nothing is 'normal.' But it's about keeping the community safe and what we have been able to create is a relatively Covid-free Australia."Australia has managed to handle the pandemic better than many countries, in part thanks to quick action from the state governments. Greater Brisbane, for example, went into a three-day lockdown earlier this month after a case of the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom was discovered.According to the Victoria state government's website on Tuesday there are 34 active cases in the region, with four internationally acquired and in quarantine in the last 24 hours, with none acquired locally in that time period.Some have pointed to the unfairness of players being able to travel and train in Melbourne while residents in other states need to apply for a permit in order to cross the internal border to Victoria. Those people who have been to "red zones" over the past 14 days -- including Victoria residents -- cannot reenter the state. There are also calls to prioritize the more than 38,000 Australians who remain stuck overseas, unable to return in part due to limits on daily international arrivals. Seeing the number of players and officials chartering flights into the country is likely to fuel the anger and desperation of many Australians abroad who have been waiting for months to return, many with no jobs or housing and facing financial hardships.Path to Tokyo 2020 The controversy has exposed the difficulties of operating a large international tournament ensuring strict coronavirus rules are followed, while maintaining an even playing field for competitors. All eyes will be on the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which despite being pushed back a year owing to the pandemic, has elected to keep the 2020 tag. The event will see athletes from all over the world descend on Japan this summer from July 23 to August 8, and the Paralympic Games from August 24 to September 5.Japan has signaled it is determined to go ahead with the Games. In a New Year's address to Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee staff, Chairman Yoshiro Mori said that preparations would proceed "as planned."Covid-19 countermeasures include athletes being tested at least once every four days and traced throughout their stay and "contact with athletes will be kept to a minimum," according to an interim report published on December 2. Japan expands state of emergency and bans entry of foreign nationals as coronavirus as infections climbDetails are scant but a scheme would allow athletes "to engage in various activities including training and participating in competitions during the 14 day self-isolation period after arrival," the report said. But Olympic officials are facing difficult decisions due to rising Covid-19 cases in the country. A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Games should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year.It comes as the capital Tokyo, along with major cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu, Tochigi and Fukuoka -- covering much of Japan's main island of Honshu -- have been placed under a coronavirus state of emergency. The total number of confirmed cases in Tokyo now stands at 86,674 and the city is suffering from a shortage of hospital beds for virus patients. The International Olympic Committee in December announced the opening and closing ceremonies will be pared-back in keeping with an "overall simplification of the Games."Speaking to CNN last week, former top International Olympic Committee official Dick Pound said that it was unlikely the Games could be postponed again, and so any additional delay would likely mean their cancellation."The one-year postponement was a proposal by Japan, the Organizing Committee said 'look, we can hold this together for another year, but not further'," he said. "Postponing it for another year, for example, will come at a huge cost, which Japan may not be willing to incur. It will further complicate a crowded sports schedule ...you're going to have the World Cup and football going on, and at some point it's just there's just too much congestion in the overall system."A spokesperson for the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee said that they were "aware of the situation" at the Australian Open and were monitoring it, and other tournaments closely. "Tournaments and games have been resumed in various competitions both in Japan and overseas, and the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee is learning a lot from these," the spokesperson said. CNN's Patrick Snell contributed to this report.
855,,(CNN)Although the freakish past 12 months has led to tragedy for many and huge disruption to the sporting calendar, golfer Tyrrell Hatton will look back on 2020 as a breakthrough year.He began it recovering from wrist surgery and sat 32nd in the world rankings, but by the end of the year he was in the top 10. "2020 has been a very strange year and difficult for a lot of people," Hatton told CNN's Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue.

"From that moment, it was an issue with my wrist, two and a half years in pain, several steroid injections to manage it. It got to the point where it's not sustainable to keep doing that. I had the operation and thankfully it helped.

In understated fashion, he reflects that this was "obviously a very nice surprise.""When you first start back, you're just hoping that you can play some decent golf and obviously you want to be in contention," he said. "To be in contention that early back from surgery was great, and I was obviously really happy with how I managed myself. We had a great week and thankfully it was my time to win."Hatton tees off on the DP World Tour Championship.It was Hatton's time to win again in October at one of the European Tour's flagship events, the BMW Championship at Wentworth, where he finished four shots ahead of Victor Perez. The victory was an especially momentous occasion for Hatton, having attended the historic tournament as a child, and was crucial for his progression into the top 10 of the world rankings. "I felt every bit of nerves that I'd expect to feel in years gone by when we've got the crowds," he said. "It was definitely nice to have those feelings and to get over the line on Sunday when naturally you are a bit nervous coming down the back nine. It was a great win."To get inside the top 10; that was definitely a career goal. So to win Wentworth and break inside the top 10 in the world rankings in the same week was very special and a dream come true really."I always thought that Wentworth was ... if I could choose one event to win it would be that one. It made it a lot sweeter."Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIn the first round of the Masters at Augusta Hatton plays a shot out of a bunker. When his thoughts turn to 2021, Hatton explains that winning majors would be "nice," making the Ryder Cup team is "the main goal," and if the opportunity to play in the Olympics arose he "would definitely go."However, with all those opportunities ahead, he is quick to point out: "There are certainly no guarantees.""You always have to just keep going and try your best."I will look back on this year with fond memories, but at the same time, I think we're all quite excited to see the back of 2020.

857,,London (CNN)Joe Biden was sworn in Wednesday as the 46th United States President, taking the reins of a country in crisis. But his task on the global stage will be daunting, too.  World leaders reacted to Biden's inauguration by offering congratulations, jockeying for position at the forefront of his foreign policy agenda, and in some cases pleading for the reversal of his predecessor's policies. Among most messages was a palpable sense of relief, as the international community embraced Biden's pledge to reenter a series of global pacts and organizations that President Donald Trump cut loose.Here's what leaders have said so far. EuropeRead More"Once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, leaving no uncertainty about her verdict on Trump's relationship with the bloc."This new dawn in America is the moment we've been waiting for so long. Europe is ready for a new start with our oldest and most trusted partner," she said in the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium.  Trump has trashed America's most important alliance. The rift with Europe could take decades to repairVon der Leyen said Biden's inauguration would "be a message of healing for a deeply divided nation and it will be a message of hope for a world that is waiting for the US to be back in the circle of like-minded states."On Twitter, she added: "The United States is back. And Europe stands ready. To reconnect with an old and trusted partner, to breathe new life into our cherished alliance."Biden has signaled a warmer partnership with Europe than Trump, who frequently criticized the EU on trade during his administration. His attacks on some European leaders led to frosty scenes at a number of summits. "From our perspective, Trump saw Europe as an enemy," a senior European diplomat told CNN last week. "The lasting impact of 'America First' is the US having fewer friends in Europe."German Chancellor Angela Merkel also offered her "warmest congratulations," adding that she looks forward to a "new chapter" in Germany's relationship with the US, according to a tweet from her spokesman Steffen Seibert. And Germany's President expressed relief that Biden would be sworn in Wednesday, calling it "a good day for democracy." "In the United States, (democracy) held up against a lot of pressure," Frank Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. "Despite internal hostility, America's institutions have proven strong -- election workers, governors, judiciary, and Congress. I am relieved that Joe Biden is sworn in as President today and coming into the White House. I know that this feeling is shared by many people in Germany."Steinmeier also warned against the populist brand of politics that Trump embraced. "Despite all the joy we have about today, we must not forget that populism has seduced even the most powerful democracy in the world," he said. "We must resolutely oppose polarization, protect and strengthen the public space of our democracies, and shape politics on the basis of reason and facts."French President Emmanuel Macron marked the day with a tweet welcoming the US back into the Paris climate agreement. "We are together. We will be stronger to face the challenges of our time. Stronger to build our future. Stronger to protect our planet. Welcome back to the Paris Agreement," Macron said.Biden will sign a slate of executive actions in the Oval Office on Wednesday, including one to rejoin the Paris Agreement.ChinaHours before the inauguration, Beijing expressed hope that Biden would "look at China rationally and objectively" to repair "serious damage" in bilateral ties caused by the Trump presidency."In the past four years, the US administration has made fundamental mistakes in its strategic perception of China ... interfering in China's internal affairs, suppressing and smearing China, and causing serious damage to China-US relations," foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a press briefing Wednesday.China asked Biden to repair "serious damage" done to the two nations' relationship.The Biden administration should, Hua said, "look at China rationally and objectively, meet China halfway and, in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, push China-US relations back to the right track of healthy and stable development as soon as possible."One of the main planks of Trump's foreign policy platform has been his trade war with China. The Trump administration's 11th-hour declaration that China is committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims will heighten tensions with Beijing, though Biden's nominee for Secretary of State said Tuesday that he agreed with the designation.  "If the new US administration can adopt a more rational and responsible attitude in formulating its foreign policy, I think it will be warmly welcomed by everyone in the international community," she added.RussiaRussia said it hoped for a "more constructive" relationship between the US and Moscow as Biden took office.The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it wanted to extend the landmark Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States for a maximum stipulated five-year period.The US-Russia arms treaty is currently due to expire just 16 days after Inauguration day."We consider it possible to prolong it only in the form in which the Agreement was signed and without any preconditions. An extension for the maximum five-year term stipulated in the Agreement looks preferable," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement released just after Biden was sworn in.The statement added that Moscow hoped for a "a more constructive approach in the dialogue with Russia and will take into account all the points mentioned above."It concluded: "For our part, we are ready for such work on the principles of equality and mutual consideration of interests," the statement concluded.Biden has previously signaled that he intends to take a tough line against potential Russian aggression.Antony Blinken, Biden's pick to lead the State Department, said Tuesday that Biden intends to seek an extension of the New START Treaty, but suggested he has not made a decision on the length of the extension. Middle EastIran's President, Hassan Rouhani, called on Biden to return to the 2015 nuclear deal and lift US sanctions on Iran, overturning a key part of Trump's foreign policy program."The ball is in the US' court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact," Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting.Iran's Rouhani hopes Biden will return to Obama-era nuclear deal as he dubs Trump a 'tyrant'He also launched a scathing attack on the outgoing President. A "tyrant's era came to an end and today is the final day of his ominous reign," Rouhani said of Trump's departure. "Someone for whom all of his four years bore no fruit other than injustice and corruption and causing problems for his own people and the world."Biden has said he plans to return to the nuclear deal with Iran, which was signed when he was Barack Obama's Vice President. Biden's national security aides have suggested they would like further negotiations on Iran's ballistic missile capabilities, though Rouhani has said the missile program is non-negotiable.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif notably did not congratulate President Biden or Vice President Harris. Zarif did say that he hoped the pair could learn from what he described as the Trump administration's mistakes."Trump, Pompeo & Co. are relegated to the dustbin of history in disgrace," Zarif said on Twitter Wednesday, shortly after the inauguration ceremony. "Perhaps new folks in DC have learned."Netanyahu and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in November.Elsewhere in the region  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Biden and Harris on what he called their "historic inauguration," and reminded the new US leader he sees Iran as their number one challenge to confront."President Biden, you and I have had a warm personal friendship going back many decades. I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the US-Israel alliance, to continue expanding peace between Israel and the Arab world and to confront common challenges, chief among them the threat posed by Iran," Netanyahu said in a video statement.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also congratulated the pair Wednesday and stressed his willingness to continue with the peace process."We look forward to working together for peace and stability in the region and the world," he said in a letter to Biden, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.In the letter, Wafa reports, Abbas "affirmed his readiness for 'a comprehensive and just peace process that would achieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people in freedom and independence.'"The Palestinian Authority broke political ties with the United States in December 2017 after then-President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with President Abbas declaring the US could no longer be an honest broker in peace talks.Warmest congratulations to @POTUS @JoeBiden on his inauguration today. We highly value our strategic partnership and enduring friendship with the United States, and we look forward to working with you in pursuit of global peace and prosperity— عبدالله بن الحسين (@KingAbdullahII) January 20, 2021 Jordan's King Abdullah II also welcomed Biden to the world stage."Warmest congratulations to [Joe Biden] on his inauguration today. We highly value our strategic partnership and enduring friendship with the United States, and we look forward to working with you in pursuit of global peace and prosperity," the monarch said on Twitter.United KingdomBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was looking forward to a close relationship with Biden's administration."In our fight against Covid and across climate change, defence, security and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand in hand to achieve them," Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. Boris Johnson will hope to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Biden's administration.Johnson warmly welcomed Trump on his visits to the UK, with Trump once claiming that the Prime Minister was nicknamed "Britain Trump." But the outgoing US leader was unpopular among Britons, and Johnson will be keen to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Biden.The new President could end up making two trips to the UK in 2021, with Johnson saying he looks forward to welcoming him to the G7 summit and to the hotly anticipated 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. "Only through international cooperation can we truly overcome the shared challenges which we face," Johnson said on Tuesday.Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was more blunt in her remarks in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. Sturgeon wished Biden and Kamala Harris well, adding: "I'm sure many of us across the chamber and across Scotland will be very happy to say cheerio to Donald Trump today.""I think 'don't haste ye back' might be the perfect rejoinder to him," she added.Queen Elizabeth also sent a private congratulatory message ahead of the inauguration to Biden, a royal source said Wednesday.The letter's content was not disclosed, but the move does follow precedent. The monarch  typically congratulates fellow heads of state at their inauguration.CanadaShortly after Biden swearing-in, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau said he would work with the new US President "to make our countries safer, more prosperous, and more resilient.""Canada and the United States enjoy one of the most unique relationships in the world, built on a shared commitment to democratic values, common interests, and strong economic and security ties," he said. "Our two countries are more than neighbours -- we are close friends, partners, and allies."Canada and the United States have worked side-by-side to tackle some of the greatest challenges we have faced in our history," Trudeau also said.Latin AmericaMexico's President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, wished Biden well ahead of his inauguration on Wednesday. During his daily briefing, López Obrador outlined three themes as key areas of the bilateral relationship with the US. "Those three themes are very important: pandemic, economic recovery and migration," he said. López Obrador also said Biden should take steps to settle the immigration status of Mexicans working in the US. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, widely considered a Trump ally, took to Twitter to congratulate the incoming US leader."I salute Joe Biden as the 46th President of the USA," Bolsonaro wrote. "The relationship [between Brazil and the US] is long, solid and based on higher values such as the defense of democracy and individual liberties. I continue committed and ready to work towards the prosperity of our nations and the well-being of our citizens."Bolsonaro said he had written Biden a letter "congratulating him for his inauguration and explaining my vision for an excellent future for the Brazil-US relationship."Ecuador's leader Lenin Moreno was particularly enthusiastic in his well wishes. "It is a great day for the United States," he wrote on Twitter. "Democracy triumphs, respect for the will of the people prevails, and those principles are strengthened in all the nations of the region."The leaders of Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia also congratulated Biden and Harris. The VaticanThe Vatican published Pope Francis' message to President Joe Biden, the United States' second Catholic President, following his inauguration."On the occasion of your inauguration as the forty-sixth President of the United States of America, I extend cordial good wishes and the assurance of my prayers that Almighty God will grant you wisdom and strength in the exercise of your high office," the message says."Under your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding.Pope Francis prayed for Biden to help build "a society marked by authentic justice and freedom.:"At a time when the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses, I pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice," the Pope wrote.IndiaIn a series of tweets, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his "warmest congratulations" to US President Joe Biden. Modi said he looks forward to working with Biden and "to strengthen (the) India-US strategic partnership." "The India-US partnership is based on shared values," he wrote. "We have a substantial and multifaceted bilateral agenda, growing economic engagement and vibrant people to people linkages. Committed to working with President @JoeBiden to take the India-US partnership to even greater heights."NATONATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called Biden's inauguration "the start of a new chapter for the transatlantic Alliance.""U.S. leadership remains essential as we work together to protect our democracies, our values and the rules-based international order," he said.

858,,(CNN)Last summer, when England's first peak of the coronavirus pandemic had subsided, Fazilah, an ICU nurse at a central London hospital, sat down to write her resignation letter. For months, she says, a wave of depression had enveloped her, but she had been too busy saving other people's lives to be able to identify it, or process it. Instead she "shoved" her feelings down into a "dark part" of her brain. The stress manifested physically: She had constant headaches, a short fuse, and couldn't eat, she said. Fazilah remembers laying on her bathroom floor for three nights -- each time after a grueling shift -- where she said she dry heaved until she fell asleep."I hadn't ate anything all night so what was going to come out? I fell asleep shortly after, only to be disturbed by those unacknowledged feelings in my dreams instead of when I was at work, because who had time to process anything in that soul-destroying place?"Read MoreFazilah ultimately decided to stay at her job, but some of her colleagues did not, "simply due to what they have seen."She's now working through another nightmare: As the UK suffers a devastating second wave of the virus, in the past week 1,182 people have died of Covid-19 in London alone. The world marks 2 million coronavirus deaths. The real toll is likely much higherInfection rates across the English capital -- the epicenter of the UK's current surge -- are around 1.5 times higher than in other parts of England according to the latest government data. And nationwide, the outlook is grim. The UK recorded the highest death rate in the world last week, according to Our World in Data, an online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford. The disease has infected more than 3.4 million people and killed more than 89,000 across the nation. In the first few months of the pandemic, intensive care unit nurses working for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) were stretched thin as they trained staff, converted wards into ICUs and, crucially, were forced to expand the "safe" NHS recommended nurse to patient ratio of 1:1 to 1:2, due to the sheer number of admissions.But as the UK battles this second wave, those NHS workers are being pushed closer to the brink, as they treat more Covid-19 patients in hospitals than at any point in the pandemic. A number of ICU workers CNN spoke to say they've been pushed to "dilute" the level of care due to the alarming surge of cases, saying that in many cases, they are treating far more than two patients at a time, and sometimes as many as eight.None of them has been authorized by their respective hospitals to speak to the media, and so all have asked for some parts of their identity to remain anonymous.Complex needs, complex carePatients who are admitted to ICUs have incredibly complex needs and are often in multiple organ failure. ICU patients require highly trained nurses to care for them -- specialists who are well-versed in treating their conditions through an array of technological interventions."When you have one nurse to one patient, you can give excellent care," said one veteran ICU worker, who asked to remain anonymous.They explained that because ICU patients are so sick and on ventilators, they require multiple drugs -- which have to be closely monitored and changed regularly --  to keep them asleep to keep their blood and heart pumping. Plus, they might also be on a dialysis machine, a "demanding" piece of equipment to filter a patient's blood.Nurses also need to closely monitor heart rates and blood pressure, they added, and if something starts to drop, they might have to change the mechanical ventilation filter."You can imagine if the nurse has to do that much for now four patients, then things are going to potentially get missed," they said, stressing that patients in ICU are now sicker then they were in the pre-pandemic."That nurse really needs to be with that one patient," they said.On Monday, there were a record 7,917 Covid-19 patients in London's hospitals, 1,220 of whom needed mechanical ventilation, according to government data. Ameera Sheikh, an ICU nurse and Unite union representative at a London hospital, told CNN that instead of one patient -- or even two -- she and her colleagues are now each looking after up to eight patients at a time.Ameera Sheikh, an ICU nurse at a London hospital said: "Nurses are essentially running around in ICUs ... for 12-15 hours without a toilet break or a glass of water." It's a situation that not only compromises the level of care for the sick, but also adds to the stress and well-being of the health care workers providing it."Nurses aren't able to deliver the care we are used to and should be giving," said Sheikh, who has been working for the NHS for 11 years. "Instead we are increasing the risk of errors occurring that can lead to patients deteriorating, life-threatening situations and death."Sheikh explained that medics without a critical care background had been redeployed to the ICU to help, but as they haven't been through specialized training, ICU nurses are also having to train and teach them on the job. A spokesperson for the NHS in London told CNN in a statement that: "The NHS has well-established plans in place to cope with additional demand and maintain patient safety." The statement added that: "Nursing staff ratios can be flexed to cope with pressure as appropriate and where it is safe to do so." UK entering 'worst point' of pandemic, top health official warns, as cases rise and bodies pile upOn Sunday, NHS chief executive Simon Stevens told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the nurse to patient ratio varied between hospitals from 1:1 to 1:2 to 1:3, and that staff are making "dynamic adjustments in real time."He said that "patients are being looked after," but that "the key point has got to be, unless the coronavirus infection rate is under control, then here, just as in every other country in the world ... these services will remain under severe pressure."  While NHS England is one of the world's biggest employers, with 1.5 million people on staff, it was already facing a huge workforce shortage before the pandemic, with about 94,000 full-time roles unfilled -- many of them in nursing and midwifery. In October, the government said that there were nearly 14,000 more nurses working in the NHS than the previous year. The Chair of the British Association of Critical Care Nurses refuted that number, saying that that there was "no evidence" of those nurses in the NHS.The pressures of the second wave have only amplified those shortages, nurses say. Some have moved out of their homes to be closer to hospitals in order to work more shifts -- and to protect their families, Sheikh explained, adding that even on off days, it's almost impossible to switch off."Guilt suddenly rushes in because you aren't at work helping. Nurses are receiving WhatsApp messages multiple times a day to work flexible shifts on their time off," she said. "That's how desperate ICUs are." Hospitals, staff 'under extreme pressure'The veteran ICU healthcare worker, who works at a different London hospital, told CNN that Covid-19 patients are coming in with critically low levels of oxygen every day.Patients are entering the emergency room terrified, she said, explaining that such low levels of oxygen can make you "feel like you are being suffocated." Medics will first attempt to get oxygen levels up with an oxygen mask and by using non-invasive ventilation, but if that doesn't work then patients will need to be put into a medically-induced coma and onto a ventilator.That procedure is fairly routine for doctors, they explained; however, low oxygen levels can make it riskier and in some cases, lead to cardiac arrest."What is difficult about this [situation] is trying to manage it all at once," the nurse said. They said that this horrifying scenario is often unfolding for multiple patients at the same time, across hospital wards that are not set up for critical care, as the ICUs are already at full capacity.A patient arrives by ambulance to a London hospital on January 8. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned last week that the country's ICUs face a substantial risk of being overwhelmed if cases keep rising. There are currently more than 37,400 Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals. Last Tuesday, there were 4,534 new admissions -- the highest number of daily admissions so far in the pandemic.Stevens said that he wasn't going to "sugar coat" the facts, saying on Sunday that hospitals and staff are "under extreme pressure."He said that in England a new person is admitted to hospital every 30 seconds. He said that the NHS had never been in such a precarious position in its 72-year history.  Last month, the Health Service Journal reported that ICU units in London were already running at 114% occupancy, forcing them to stretch capacity, and that requests had been made by hospitals there to send critical care patients to hospitals in Yorkshire, more than 200 miles to the north. Stevens confirmed on Sunday that a "small number" of patients had been transferred from one region to another.A Best Western hotel in London is now taking in Covid-19 patients as hospitals run out of bedsMeanwhile, last week, a south London hotel became the first to take part in a government pilot program to relieve local hospitals by converting spare hotel rooms into recovery wards. Many of the healthcare professionals CNN spoke to for this article hold Johnson's Conservative government accountable for the mess. They say that delayed lockdowns and fumbled messaging around Christmas all contributed to the surge, and have added to public frustrations.On Monday, a government spokesperson told CNN: "Our approach has always been guided by scientific and medical advice. As soon as we became aware that the new variant transmits more easily, we significantly reduced the Christmas relaxations and introduced stay-at-home restrictions where it was most prevalent.""As the Prime Minister has said, we are seeing some early signs of progress, but we continue to monitor the data and keep restrictions under review."Conspiracy theorists who believe that the coronavirus is a hoax and anti-lockdown groups have capitalized on that discord and are making it worse. Sheikh said she was aware of videos purportedly showing empty hospital corridors and a hospital coffee shop making their way across social media. But patients aren't kept in coffee shops nor in hospital corridors, she said, adding that maintaining patients' dignity and privacy is at the forefront of all care."These people haven't seen the inside of an ICU and haven't had difficult conversations with families about withdrawing life [support] because we've done everything in our power to sustain it," Sheikh said of the conspiracy theorists.  At a press conference with the Prime Minister earlier this month, Stevens condemned the videos and the people who continue to wrongly claim that the pandemic is not real."If you sneak into a hospital -- in an empty corridor at nine o'clock at night -- and film that particular corridor, and then stick it up on social media and say, 'This proves the hospitals are empty, the whole thing is a hoax', you are not only responsible for potentially changing behavior that will kill people, but it is an insult to the nurse coming home from 12 hours in critical care, having worked her guts out under the most demanding and trying of circumstances," he said. "There's nothing more demoralizing than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it's most obviously untrue."A 'constant carousel'While health care workers try to shrug off the people spreading misinformation, many nurses say it does affect morale. Plus, the surge in cases means that planned or elective surgeries are being postponed.Fazilah, the ICU nurse in central London told CNN that she wishes that people could see how much effort and patience it takes to navigate through a day in full PPE without "wanting to shout at someone because you're so tired and frustrated, and your workload is tripled." "The burden of having three patients is immense," she said, explaining that Covid-19 patients add an additional element of unpredictability, as they can shift from being stable to being in cardiac arrest "out of nowhere."UK emergency Covid-19 field hospitals asked to be 'ready' to admit patients as crisis looms"If one of my three patients suddenly deteriorates, I feel horrifically guilty ... thinking 'Why didn't I see that coming?' or 'What could I have done to prevent it?' -- when in reality I could have done nothing," Fazilah said, adding that "It's extremely difficult" to leave those shifts to rest. "When you're back the next day ... all you're worrying about is their family and how would you feel if that was your loved one."Not being able to switch off can be frightening, Fazilah said, adding that when a patient dies, there is often little time to grieve before the next patient arrives in the ward."It's like you're on a constant carousel and you can't get off," she said.Last week, a King's College London study found that a large proportion of intensive care unit staff surveyed in the UK have reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or depression, and some feeling they would be better off dead.For some nurses, having to help families say goodbye to their relatives remotely, since they unable to do so in person, has contributed to that trauma. Fazilah described the "horrific" experience of having to hold up a tablet to a dying patient's ear so their family members could speak to them. "The impact of that and imagining that it could be you saying bye to your parents or loved ones, is so much more damaging than people realize," she said. "And it stays with you."
859,,(CNN)Spanish police have seized more than two tons of cocaine and arrested 12 people allegedly involved in a large scale drugs smuggling network with connections to Paraguay and Brazil.Authorities investigated the network -- members of which had attempted to cover their tracks by setting up legitimate businesses -- for more than a year, according to a statement from Spain's national police on Monday.The investigation culminated in the arrests and the seizure of 2,065 kilograms (2.28 US tons) hidden in a shipment of 40,000 kilograms (44.1 US tons) of charcoal at the port of Algeciras in southern Spain.The drugs were hidden inside a container of charcoal sent from Paraguay.At the beginning of 2020, police identified members of the organization based in the provinces of Murcia and Seville who were building an apparently legitimate business importing dozens of containers of charcoal from South America to the port of Barcelona.However, complications due to storage issues and the coronavirus pandemic meant the group moved their operations to the port of Algeciras in southern Spain in mid-April, said police.Read MorePolice pieced together the structure of the network, which included two families with key members in Brazil and Paraguay who coordinated cocaine shipments, while others in Seville created businesses which appeared to be dedicated to importing charcoal, rice, molasses or medical products.Spain seizes 'narco sub' carrying more than 3 tons of cocainePolice said the leaders of the network recruited people to act as fronts for the businesses to hide their involvement, and a known money launderer based in Valencia acted as an emissary between them and the business owners.Police said the money launderer used cryptocurrencies to hide money, and is known to work with "many criminal groups from Eastern Europe and South America" involved in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and people.The sophistication of the network meant police had to tap more than 100 phones and follow suspects in various Spanish provinces. During the course of the investigation, agents also searched 16 homes and businesses as well as almost 200 containers sent to Spain from Brazil and Paraguay, said the statement.All 12 have been charged, with six being held in custody and six being released under specific conditions. Their names have not been publicly released.
860,,(CNN)A record-breaking run chase at the Gabba saw India topple Australia to take an unlikely 2-1 series victory.India needed 328 to win on Tuesday -- the final day of the four-test series -- as Shubman Gill's 91 and an unbeaten 89 from Rishabh Pant led the charge for the touring side.Pant hit the winning runs with just three overs remaining to inflict a first defeat on Australia at the Gabba since 1988 and record the highest fourth innings run chase at the Brisbane fortress.It comes exactly a month on from India being bowled out for a lackluster 36 in the first Test in Adelaide -- the team's lowest ever score in Test cricket.

He eventually fell lbw to Pat Cummins, who finished the day with four wickets for 55 runs, while Gill was caught behind by Steve Smith off Nathan Lyon. Batting out for the draw would have been a safe option and enough to keep hold of the series trophy, but India kept up the chase.Stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane hit a quickfire 24 off 22 balls before Pant, at the crease with Navdeep Saini to hit the winning runs, steered India nervelessly to a remarkable victory.

861,,(CNN)AC Milan fans would have been forgiven for fearing that Father Time was eventually catching up with Zlatan Ibrahimovic.The Swedish forward had been absent from the starting lineup since picking up an injury against Napoli back in November, but he returned against Cagliari on Monday looking very much back to his best.Ibrahimovic's two goals -- the first a penalty he won himself and the second a trademark clinical finish after latching onto a through ball -- took the 39-year-old's tally for the season to 12 and, more importantly, ensured Milan restored its three-point lead at the top of Serie A.Zlatan Ibrahimovic took his tally for the season to 12 goals."He is a champion in everything he does," AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli told reporters after the game. "With his comeback, we have other tactical possibilities and we are very happy to have him."He still manages to surprise me, even though I know him well by now.

862,,(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin has braved ice-cold temperatures for an Epiphany Dip in a pool outside of Moscow, according to a video and photos posted by the Kremlin press pool on Tuesday.In the footage, the 68-year-old is seen exiting a log cabin wearing a long sheepskin coat, disrobing and submerging himself three times in a cross-shaped pool crowned with an ice-carved Crucifixion statue. Temperatures in the Moscow region have been at around -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past week.Celebrated on January 19, Epiphany Day commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. On Epiphany, water is considered holy, and many people across Russia and Eastern Europe take a dip as a sign of their Orthodox Christian faith. Why Putin wants to keep Navalny locked upThe tradition is widely believed to bring good health, toughen one's immune system and wash away sins.Read MorePutin's photo op comes as Russia works to ramp up vaccination efforts and bring its coronavirus outbreak under control, and days after his political rival Alexei Navalny was arrested on his return to Moscow.Putin's blue swimming trunks in the footage were noticed across Russian social media, given their similarity to the missing blue underwear allegedly used to poison Navalny with nerve-agent Novichok last year.Navalny has told CNN that he is certain Putin knew of an elaborate shadowing operation by elite agents before he was poisoned. The Kremlin has previously denied any involvement in Navalny's poisoning.Putin's icy dip isn't the first time he has stripped down in public. In 2018, he bathed in the icy waters of Lake Seliger to mark Epiphany. He's also been photographed topless while fishing in 2017 and bare-chested as he rode a horse on vacation in 2009.

864,,(CNN)Britain's youngest convicted terrorist, who was sentenced to life in prison for masterminding a plot to behead an Australian police officer in broad daylight in 2015, can now be set free, a parole board ruled on Monday.The 20-year-old man, from Blackburn, Lancashire, was aged 14 when he planned the strike in Melbourne for Anzac Day -- a national holiday honoring Australia's war dead -- according to CNN affiliates Seven News and Nine News. Because he was a minor, he can only be identified as RXG.RXG recruited Australian co-conspirator Sevdet Besim, who was 18 at the time, to carry out the attack, in which a police officer was to be beheaded in front of thousands of people during Anzac Day celebrations.The plan was ultimately uncovered and foiled by police, and both were arrested. Later that year, RXG was sentenced to life in prison for inciting terrorism overseas. Britain's youngest terror mastermind jailed for life for Anzac Day plotBut on Monday, the Parole Board for England and Wales ruled that he could be set free, Seven News and Nine News reported.Read More"After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in detention, and the evidence presented at the hearings, the panel was satisfied that RXG was suitable for release," the board said in a statement.A military march on Anzac Day in 2015 in Melbourne, Australia, where RXG and Besim had planned a foiled attack.RXG managed to convince Besim that he was much older and had a history of radicalism, and the pair set out the details of the attack in thousands of messages sent using an encrypted app.But the plan was foiled, police say, when RXG threatened to behead teachers at his school in northern England -- prompting counterterrorism experts to crack the encryption code on his phone and find the messages.Alerted by their counterparts in the United Kingdom, Australian police closed in on Besim in Melbourne. In 2016, Besim was sentenced to at least seven and a half years in prison, according to Seven News and Nine News.

"Fortnite has been around for over three years now," Nate Nanzer, Head of Global Partnerships at Epic Games, told CNN Sport. "We've spent a lot of time listening to our players and having conversations with them about what do they want to see next."Overwhelmingly, the sport that we hear from our players that is most wanted to come to the game is global football, soccer."Read MoreTheir wish has now been granted as 23 clubs across five continents, including Manchester City, Juventus and AC Milan, are entering into partnership with Fortnite to bring the first-ever official football kit inspired skins to the game."It's a truly global launch," added Nanzer.

866,,(CNN)Russia's leading Kremlin critic, Alexey Navalny, was detained by police in the outskirts of Moscow on Sunday, moments after his return to the country and five months after he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok.Live footage from Russian broadcaster TV Rain showed him talking with dark-uniformed and masked officers at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, then kissing his wife Yulia before walking away with them.The couple were returning from a five-month stay in Germany, where he had been recovering from the Novichok poisoning. They landed at Sheremetyevo just after 8 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET), according to flight data information. "This is the best day in the past five months," Navalny told journalists at the airport just before his arrest. "Everyone is asking me if I'm scared. I am not afraid," he said. "I feel completely fine walking towards the border control. I know that I will leave and go home because I'm right and all the criminal cases against me are fabricated."Read MoreNavalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list last month for violating terms of probation related to a years-old fraud case, which he dismisses as politically motivated. A statement on Sunday from the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) confirmed Navalny had been detained, and said he would remain in custody until a court hearing later this month, according to TASS. He is being held at a police station in the city of Khimki, just north of Central Moscow, and has not been allowed access to his lawyer, according to Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh and regional coordinator Leonid Volkov.Passengers and journalists take photos of Alexey Navalny as he takes his seat on the flight Sunday.Navalny has been a perennial thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin's side, raising concerns for his safety in the country.A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny's August poisoning, piecing together how an elite unit at the agency followed Navalny's team throughout a trip to Siberia, when Navalny fell ill from exposure to military-grade Novichok.The investigation also found that this unit, which included chemical weapons experts, had followed Navalny on more than 30 trips to and from Moscow since 2017. Russia denies involvement in Navalny's poisoning. Putin himself said in December that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they "would have finished" the job. Nevertheless, several Western officials and Navalny himself have openly blamed the Kremlin.Flight diverted to SheremetyevoRussian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, right, and his wife, Yulia Navalnya, on a Pobeda airlines plane heading to Moscow before take-off from Berlin on Sunday.Navalny's flight from Berlin on Russian carrier Pobeda was originally scheduled to land at Vnukovo airport, where a crowd of hundreds of supporters and journalists waited to greet him. Videos by independent media outlets Novaya Gazet and Media Zona showed police arresting several allies waiting at Vnukovo amid temperatures of around -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees F), including politician and lawyer Lyubov Sobol and Ruslan Shaveddinov, who works for Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. The flight was diverted at the last minute to Sheremetyevo. According to the Vnukovo press office, the flight was redirected due to an "emergency situation" in which two runways were blocked by equipment that had been stuck in the snow, Russian media group RBC reported.  But Navalny blamed the change of destination on the Russian government, apologizing to his fellow passengers upon landing. "I would like to apologize to the passengers on this flight. As I understand, hundreds of people suffered because Vnukovo was closed, thousands of people apparently got stuck simply because the road to Vnukovo had been blocked, here traffic was restricted."He added: "They are jeopardizing the air safety of a wonderful big city. Why? Just so Putin could say: "Who needs him?!"After he was taken into custody, his wife Yulia Navalny told reporters, "They are so afraid of [Navalny], they paralyzed all flights in Moscow tonight, so many people were let down over a man who simply flew back to his homeland.""The most important thing is what Alexey said today," she added. "He is not afraid, I am not afraid, and I urge you all not to be afraid either." Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is seen in a Pobeda plane after it landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on January 17, 2021.European leaders and diplomats reacted quickly to news of Navalny's detention, with European Parliament President David Sassoli and European Council President Charles Michel among the many calling for Russian authorities to release him."The detainment of Alexey Navalny upon arrival in Moscow is unacceptable. I call on Russian authorities to immediately release him," tweeted Michel.Navalny's arrest "is an offence to the international community, to Europe that helped save his life. We ask the Russian authorities for his immediate release," tweeted Sassoli. "We are ready to invite him to the European Parliament."The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted that it was "deeply concerned" about Navalny's detention, adding: "A vibrant civil society and political opposition are cornerstones of all democratic societies. Austria calls for his immediate release and a full & independent investigation into the attack on his life."Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called for Navalny's immediate release in a tweet, saying that "Politicisation of the judiciary is unacceptable."In the US, members of both the incoming and outgoing presidential administrations voiced support for Navalny. "The Kremlin's attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard," tweeted Jake Sullivan, National Security Adviser for the incoming Biden administration.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also issued a statement condemning the detention. "We note with grave concern that his detention is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny and other opposition figures and independent voices who are critical of Russian authorities," he said. What's next for Navalny?Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation have been the subjects of a number of legal cases, which he and allies believe are politically motivated. In 2014, Navalny was found guilty of fraud after he and his brother Oleg were accused of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. While Navalny was given a suspended sentence, his brother was jailed. On December 28, FSIN accused Navalny of violating the terms of his probation by failing to show up for scheduled inspections while in Germany and requested that a court replace his suspended sentence with a real prison term.Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, said the claim was unreasonable. "The Penitentiary Service --knowing full well that Navalny is being treated in Germany -- is trying to jump on the last train (Alexey's probation period ends on December 30!) and demands that he reports for inspection tomorrow!" she tweeted.A hearing has been scheduled for January 29. If the FSIN request is granted, Navalny will likely be jailed for 3.5 years, according to the court's press service as reported by RAPSI. CNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned If Navalny is not convicted later in January, he will still face an investigation for a newer fraud case, in which he and his Anti-Corruption Foundation have been accused of misusing donations from supporters. In a video address posted on his Instagram last month, Navalny called the new criminal cases brought up against him in Russia "demonstratively fabricated" and an attempt to prevent him from coming back to Russia.  Alexey Navalny in hospital in Berlin, Germany, on September 15, 2020."The situation with Navalny looks like two trains running towards each other at full speed, bound to collide," said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. "There will be many victims."Attacks on Navalny's allies have indeed continued. Pavel Zelensky, a cameraman with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, was arrested Friday and will be detained until the end of February. His lawyer has not commented on the case. According to Agora, a Russian human rights organization, Zelensky was accused of extremism for tweets from September, in which he blamed the government for journalist Irina Slavina's self-immolation. Before taking her own life, Slavina blamed pressure from Russian law enforcement for her decision to take her own life.CNN's Claudia Otto and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report.

In his first appearance since he was detained by border inspectors at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport last night, Navalny slammed the proceedings as "lawlessness at its highest point" and a "mockery of justice."

870,,(CNN)Greek Olympic gold medalist Sofia Bekatorou's very public detailing of her alleged sexual assault in 1998 by a high-ranking Hellenic Sailing Federation (HSF) official has sparked an outcry in the Mediterranean country over the way her revelations were initially dealt with. Bekatorou did not name the person she is accusing. On Saturday, Aristides Adamopoulos -- the vice Chairman of the HSF Board -- resigned, according to the Greek sailing body."It is expected that complaints against me made by a public figure, of great recognition and wide social impact, will gather public interest, create feelings of compassion for the complainant and disgust for the alleged 'perpetrator,'" said Adamopoulos in a statement as he called for due process.Later on Saturday, in a statement posted on the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) website, Adamopoulos said Bekatorou's accusation was "false and defamatory.""Nevertheless, I fully understand that due to the extensive negative publicity of the matter, it is very likely there will be damage to the status of the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which must always remain high for the good of Greek sport," said Adamopoulos.Read More"For this reason alone and fully aware of my responsibility towards the HOC, I declare that from today and until the full clarification of this case by the authorities I will abstain from meetings of the HOC bodies which I am a member and I will generally abstain from the exercise of my duties from any position I hold."CNN does not usually identify people who say they were sexually assaulted, but Bekatorou came forward publicly with her allegations.Bekatorou said the alleged assault took place in 1998 during preparations for the Sydney Olympics, that were held two years later.One of Greece's best-known female athletes, Bekatorou won a sailing gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and then bronze four years later at the Beijing Games.Now 43, Bekatorou said a male official performed a "lewd act" after inviting her to his hotel room to discuss preparations ahead of the Sydney Olympics. The athlete said the act was not consensual. She made the allegation earlier this week at an online event organized by the Ministry of Culture and Sports about the protection of children in sport.Bekatorou said she wanted to talk about her traumatic experience in the hope that young athletes would not be afraid to speak out."I said no, I repeated that I didn't want to go on and he used fake sweet talk and said it is nothing and trying to be funny," said Bekatorou."He said he would stop if I didn't want it but he didn't, no matter what I said to him. Crying and feeling ashamed I left the room when he finished and removed himself from me."Initially in response to the allegation, the HSF said it had never previously received a formal or informal complaint from Bekatorou. It also urged the athlete to reveal specific details, while referring to the alleged sexual violence as an "unpleasant incident," causing public outcry in Greece with athletes, politicians, and senior public figures describing it as a disgrace.However on Saturday, the HSF made a sudden about-face, releasing an additional statement."In order to preserve the prestige of the Federation, the honor and reputation of all athletes, coaches and actors in the sport and to facilitate the investigation for which the final decision is made by Justice, we immediately requested and received the resignation of vice Chairman of the Board Aristides Adamopoulos," said the HSF.Since Bekatorou came forward to recount her experience, an increasing number of prominent athletes have issued statements of support. Some have also come out with their experiences of sexual harassment. They include a former sailing champion, Marina Psychogyiou, who in a Facebook post alleges sexual harassment from an HSF official in the early 1990s, and retired high jumper Niki Bakogianni, a silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympics, who posted a message recounting an incident of sexual harassment from an official of her sports federation that allegedly took place over two decades ago.Their voices are joined by those of ordinary Greeks who are coming out on social media with personal accounts of traumatic experiences of sexual harassment.  Bekatorou carried her country's flag during the Opening Ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at Maracana Stadium on August 5, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Athens prosecutorAdamopoulos said he was being subjected to trial by the media."It is the minimal conquest of any democratic state governed by the rule of law and the corresponding obligation of institutions and the media not to target individuals, distribute their photographs, or to have already convicted the so called "perpetrator" before he is given the opportunity to speak and give his view on facts made public by a third party," said Adamopoulos in a statement.Meanwhile, another two senior HSF board members have submitted their resignations in support of Bekatorou.Greece's entire political spectrum has rallied behind Bekatorou. And after saying he had talked with Bekatorou, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also praised her courage to speak out."Sofia bravely broke the chain of fear and silence, showing the way for the stigma of guilt to pass from the victim to the perpetrator. This way she became an Olympiad of responsibility, on behalf of us all," Mitsotakis said in a statement posted on Facebook.In an act of support high in symbolism, Greece's President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the country's first female president, has invited Bekatorou to the country's presidential mansion on Monday.The Hellenic Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. IOC member and HOC head Spyros Kapralos has also said he would support Bekatorou with "all his might'" and called on other athletes to speak up."We need to have a safe, ethical, decent and pure sports environment," said Kapralos in a statement on Saturday.Meanwhile Greek media reported on Saturday that the Athens prosecutor will order a preliminary investigation on Monday, with Bekatorou expected to testify on Wednesday morning.Additional reporting by John Sinnott and Chris Liakos.
871,,(CNN)Tom Brady remains on track to win a seventh Super Bowl ring as he led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 30-20 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.In a game that saw Brady up against fellow veteran quarterback Drew Brees -- the pair's combined age of 85 years and 169 days is the oldest combined age of opposing starting quarterbacks in a single game -- it was the Bucs' new signing who had the upper hand with two touchdown passes as well as scoring one himself. The result means the Bucs, whose sole Super Bowl title came 18 years ago, face the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game -- Brady's ninth championship game in 10 seasons. Meanwhile, current champions the Kansas City Chiefs will face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship game.The Chiefs lost quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a concussion in the third quarter against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday but managed to grind out a 22-17 win. Read MoreBrady celebrates against the Saints.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresBrees' uncertain futureWhile the Saints led in the early exchanges at Mercedes-Benz Superdome, it was the Bucs' defense that forced crucial turnovers and proved decisive. Brady's two touchdown passes were finished by Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette before his own score in the fourth quarter settled the game. "For us going into this week, we had to play a great game, and our defense stepped up and played huge," said Brady. "Like I said, the offensive line was incredible. It was just a hard-fought game, a very physical game. "We'll need to get our rest ... and be ready to go for practice on Wednesday."For Brees, this could have been the final game of his career with uncertainty over the 42-year-old's future swirling. Brees walks off the field after defeat by Tampa Bay. When asked about his quarterback's future, Saints coach Sean Payton said it's "probably for another press conference." He added: "Obviously, he's been tremendous for this team, this city, I could go on and on. But let's wait and answer that at the right time."READ: Eying successive Super Bowl titles, Kansas City Chiefs prepare to 'heal' ahead of playoffsREAD: 'If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL,' says NFL cheerleader'Not going to flinch'In Sunday's other game, the Chiefs had to call upon backup quarterback Chad Henne to guide the team to victory over the Browns. Mahomes, last season's Super Bowl MVP, had opened the scoring as he ran in a one-yard touchdown before finding Travis Kelce for the game's second touchdown. But he was forced off the field midway through the third quarter due to concussion protocol and in the second half the Browns started to close the gap in the scoreline. Mahomes looks on from the sidelines during the second quarter of the Chiefs' win. "Somewhere you've got to be able to reach deep in tough times and pull that out," said Chiefs head coach Andy Reid of the way his team reacted after losing Mahomes and held on for the win."And if the coaches are flinching, if the players -- your leaders -- are flinching, it's not going to happen."And our locker room is not going to flinch. They're tough that way."The Chiefs now face the Bills on January 24 for a spot in Super Bowl LV.
872,,(CNN)It's a question that has been asked for 50 years -- again and again."Why do these people continue to make a mockery of our culture?" The question in 1970 was posed by Dennis Banks in reference to the use of Native American heritage being used for names and mascots for American sports teams. Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team's name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the "Eskimos" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term "Eskimo." "While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker," said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable "EE" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the "Football Team" name may remain the team's long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there's arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn't just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism."Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on," she says."And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don't have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. "And obviously that's troubling because that's a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures." The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that "the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, 'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?'"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its "harmful use of Indigenous Peoples' imagery and branding." It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team's mascot, "Big Chief." The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was "in fact highly respectful."As for the "Chiefs" name, the club said that the name "dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area," the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as "incredibly disappointing," and that the club had "thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club." "We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory," they continued. "But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it."The group concluded its statement saying that they were "horrified" and that "the decision will not age well."In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot "Big Chief" but will not remove the "Chiefs" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club's logo, and that the cultural context was "a positive one." It says that the club represents "respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor."Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it "draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today."KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team's logo can cause, but said it would remain the club's logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is "willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument."CNN was told by the club that it reached out to "some [Native American] organizations/representatives" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an "exchange of views."The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives "would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future."CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known "Guarani" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn't receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar's Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club's stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. "In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant 'Indio' it's derogatory," he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people."Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century."The club's mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club's website, which is entitled "Indio."Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense's mascot is an indigenous person."They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes."It isn't just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: "Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that's very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that's very insulting towards people."The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: "They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes."Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that "despite the pejorative" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as "an honor.""It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play."The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won't change it."Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: "It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes," as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough."Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus," he says. "People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes."Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America."In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. "So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as 'Indios.'"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, "they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle."He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency."It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign," Pinto says. "He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises."During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile's most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club's badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo's badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are "essential differences" from other teams around the globe which "have a negative or derogatory charge."According to Pinto, the club was founded by "rebels and workers", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the "Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts "to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people," along with "performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities."Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: "They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn't give a sh*t."There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.

876,,(CNN)The presidency of Donald Trump has left such a wretched stench in Europe that it's hard to see how, even in four years, Joe Biden could possibly get America's most important alliance back on track.  This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo canceled a final trip to meet with European and NATO leaders. While the State Department claimed the reason for his cancellation was so Pompeo could work on the Biden transition, European officials suspect that America's top diplomat realized he'd arranged a leaving party no one wanted to attend.  Throughout Trump's term, Europeans have been walking a tightrope, trying to balance outright condemnation of the President's most destructive behavior with not alienating the leader of the Western world.Pompeo was unlikely to be received warmly on his farewell tour, even before the insurrection at the US Capitol last Wednesday. For many, Trump's incitement of rioters was the final straw.Pompeo cancels Europe trip after Luxembourg snubThe foreign minister of Luxembourg openly called Trump a "pyromaniac," ​while diplomats are privately saying they "blame Trump squarely for the chaos in America since the election, including the Capitol riot," as one did to CNN, reflecting the sentiments of others in the same role.Read More"It was clearly not going to be a congenial trip, as many European institutions and diplomats are happily turning their back on the Trump administration. It's no secret that Europe is very much looking forward to working with Biden," said Tyson Barker, a senior Europe analyst and former State Department official under Barack Obama. This week's snub of Pompeo brings an ignominious end to four years of exacerbation with a White House that went out of its way to burn bridges with allies who were caught off guard by the election of Trump, then horrified at his administration's inability to rein in his worst instincts.  "From our perspective, Trump saw Europe as an enemy," a senior European diplomat told CNN. "The lasting impact of 'America First' is the US having fewer friends in Europe." A senior European Union official said the general view in Brussels was that Trump went out of his way to "gradually undo a lot of what the EU was working towards on the world stage," pointing specifically to the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.  While the assumption is that the transatlantic relationship will improve under Biden, four years of carnage has spooked the European political scene.  "The European relationship has changed and will now be shrouded in skepticism," said Cathryn Cluver Ashbrook, executive director of the Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship at the Harvard Kennedy School.  "The arrival of a Biden administration has yet to be embraced with the same fanfare as Obama as President-elect, because Trump has done more damage to the relationship than George W. Bush. Trump's outward aggression affected all aspects of European life, be it trade, defense or even the emotional shared ideas and cultural ties. All those things suddenly seem debased and of less value." At the 11th hour, Trump hands Biden a whole new set of foreign policy headaches The repudiation of shared ideas and cultural ties Cluver describes are one prong of the fork that has punctured the alliance. According to Barker, officials in European capitals were agog at the types of people Trump employed to work as envoys overseas.  "Europeans have considered the last four years extremely distasteful. They've been bemused by Trump's envoys, like Richard Grenell in Germany, who have turned up and started behaving like Fox News anchors and insulting the country they were supposed to be building relations with," Barker said.   Another prong has been the practical implication of Trump's approach to foreign policy. "Trump's disengagement and hollowing out of the State Department meant that we were suddenly without our most important ally on projects in the Middle East and Africa," a senior German diplomat told CNN.  "When they did take big stances on things like China or Iran, they chose not to involve anyone, leaving Europeans scrambling for a response," the diplomat added.Cluver says this has forced a structural change in the dynamics between allies. "Europeans have had to carry the can on things like the Iran deal and climate change. On one hand, this means that Biden can pick up where Obama left off with some serious American muscle. But he might have to accept that America's role in these relationships has changed." Barker agreed, saying it would be "important to see how the new administration acknowledges the damage that has been done by Trump to America's reputation." And on top of the big picture issues like Iran and China, Barker said, "how can [Biden] send State Department officials to Ukraine to warn about corruption with any immediate credibility?"  This idea, that Europe has lost its trust in America, comes up time and again when speaking to European diplomats and EU officials. Cluver believes the combination of unpredictability from the White House and "US bureaucracy being dismantled from the inside to make it less effective worldwide" under Trump means we have crossed the Rubicon. "American influence in European defense, security, and other global priorities has diminished. This has led to lots of countries having to think more seriously about their future with a less assertive US," she added.Despite optimism that Biden will restore a more collaborative approach to shared priorities, European diplomats and officials are adamant that moves towards an independent defense policy and international "strategic autonomy" will not slow down.  "In some respects, it was a good thing Trump forced us to think more about diplomatic initiatives, NATO and withdrawal of US troops," said the German diplomat. "It might come as a shock to Biden, but the prospect of the US underpinning European security is not as attractive as it was when he and Obama left office."  Washington's agony is a win for autocrats and strongmenA view many European officials share is that no matter how friendly Biden is, Trump happened once -- and could happen again. The President lost the election, but clearly there is still a lot of support for his politics. In 2024, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Mike Pompeo, or any other of his allies could conceivably pick up the torch and win an election."We cannot afford to be naive. If you look at the number of votes that Trump got, he wields an influence on American voters. This anti-global, 'America First' undercurrent in American politics is still very much alive and we have to hedge our bets," said the EU diplomat.  Cluver is equally convinced that Trump's supporters are going nowhere, not least because they are unlike traditional voters. "A lot of his followers have been radicalized by conspiracy theories spread by groups like QAnon," she said. "Even if Biden succeeds in his domestic agenda, it will be difficult to pull people away from Trump's movement. Worse, elected representatives who want to bank on their support in the midterms and might continue pandering to them."If this all sounds a little gloomy, to some extent, it is. "Bush was supposed to be an aberration and Obama a restoration," said Barker. "This idea of a reset seems a much tougher sell, especially since Trump's used his lame-duck period to burn the house on the way out."   It will take more than four years for the fog to lift over the Atlantic, and there are fears the relationship between Europe and America will never go back to what it was. For Europeans, that's a reality they're determined to make the best of. For the US, it's unclear whether being downgraded as a diplomatic force is something that its citizens, who've lived through four introspective years of "America First," will even care about.  Regardless, the Trump era has left Europeans with little choice but to wait and see how much of a priority Biden places on reclaiming America's place on the world stage. And they will use the four years of relative quiet under Biden to build safeguards against the all too real possibility of another Euroskeptic firestarter winning the White House in 2024.
877,,(CNN)The 2020-2021 Premier League season is a proving a bumper campaign for penalties.We're not even at the half-way point yet but already there have been 69 spot-kicks awarded. Compare that to the 2019-2020 season when 92 penalties in total were given.Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has credited former manager Jose Mourinho for making his team more "savvy" when it comes to winning penalties suggesting, as many thought, that winning a spot-kick may be more complicated than you might first think.Speaking to the Football Writers' Association (FWA) on Thursday, Rashford said a conversation with Mourinho, who managed United between 2016-2018, changed the way he approached his behavior in the box."As a forward line, we want to go and score goals, when you are making runs in behind or dribbling with the ball and if you see a challenge coming, you don't want to get tackled because you are looking at an opportunity to score a goal," Rashford told the FWA.Read More"There is no way you are going to let somebody take the ball off you, so for me it is just a case of us wanting to score goals and the teams wanting to defend goals and penalties can happen.""I remember when Jose [Mourinho] was manager, there were five or six times where I should have had a penalty and Jose ended up saying to me: 'If you are not savvy about the way you do it, then you are not going to be given it.'"After that, we started to get a few penalties. It was something that in terms of development you have to learn that and understand it."READ: Jurgen Klopp takes a swipe at Manchester United after a frustrating defeatMarcus Rashford says he has learned to be "savvy" to win penalties. 'I don't think you can blame players'Players from every team in the league have long been accused of diving or of going down too easily on occasion.To some, it's a blatant disregard for the credibility of the game whilst others see it as mastering a necessary dark art.Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey says he doesn't blame players who go down after contact in the box, admitting officials don't tend to give fouls when players stay on their feet."I don't think you can blame players for going down under contact because they are asking the question of the referee. They're just doing their job," Halsey told CNN Sport."Perhaps referees have been to blame partly because when there has been a clear penalty and the player hasn't gone down, the referee hasn't given it."When you're going at pace into the box and there is slight contact, you will lose balance and you will go down [...] it's not easy for referees."Rashford's comments come amid an increasingly heated debate over penalties being awarded in the Premier League, perhaps fueled by a potential title race not many had predicted at the start of the season: United versus fierce rivals Liverpool. The two teams meet on Sunday when first meets second in the table.The spat started after Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp questioned United's penalty record earlier this month, saying it had "more penalties in two years than I had in five-and-a-half years."Solskjaer initially brushed off Klopp's comments, saying he doesn't spend his time counting how many penalties Liverpool gets, but did suggest that such comments might influence decisions in the future.United has been awarded 32 penalties since the start of the 2018/19 season compared to Liverpool's 17. The Old Trafford club also set a new Premier League record after it was awarded 14 penalties last season. After United beat Leicester City in the previous campaign -- courtesy of a Rashford penalty -- Solskjaer reflected on his team's knack of winning spot-kicks: "I think it's the type of players we've got. They've got quick feet, good skills and most of [the penalties] haven't even been debatable."Bruno Fernandes converts a penalty for Manchester United this season. 'Nonsense' However, Manchester United (six) has only been awarded one more penalty than Liverpool in the league this season, while both teams have scored the same amount (five).It's true to say a number of these penalties have been controversial, even with VAR's help.Halsey says the introduction of multiple replays has actually made the referee's job harder, by slowing down the incident too much and showing countless different angles."If you slow it [footage] down and watch it enough times, you can make an argument for any decision," he says.But Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for 14 years, says any suggestion that United is treated more favorably than other teams is "nonsense."He also says the concept of managers getting into the referee's head is overplayed."All the managers do it [compain about decisions.] It's just part of the course of managers playing mind games with the opposition and maybe with referees," he said."When I was doing these games, I never watched the press conferences, you just go and referee what's in front of you."You sometimes had managers waiting for you at halftime, having a right go at you and trying to get into your head but you've got to be mentally tough and that's why you're refereeing at the top level."READ: Messi scores twice to help resurgent Barcelona move to third in La LigaLiverpool's boss Jurgen Klopp has been angered by United's penalty record. 'We want something they have'Such discourse has laid the foundations for Sunday's tantalizing fixture as United travel to face Liverpool at Anfield.Solskjaer's side is currently three points ahead of the reigning champion which has struggled for form in recent weeks.Another win over its rivals could see the Old Trafford side stake a real claim for this season's title -- an achievement which might well surprise even the strongest of United's supporters."Being where we are in the league just gives us more confidence and it's a sign of where we are at," said Solskjaer in his pre-match press conference."The game against the champions, who have an amazing record at Anfield, is a great test for us."Can we go there and cause an upset? We are the challengers and they have earned the right to be champions. We want something they have."
878,,(CNN)For decades, cheerleaders have been synonymous with the NFL.  Providing a touch of glamor, dance teams across the US entertain thousands of fans every week, representing their franchise in the local community.  But behind some of the smiles and perfectly choreographed routines lies a world of painstaking work and alleged unequal pay. A new documentary, "A Woman's Work: The NFL's Cheerleader Problem," exposes the underbelly of a seemingly glamorous pursuit and follows the lives of two women who ​say they decided enough was enough.   Former cheerleader Lacy Thibodeaux-Fields was the first to speak out, filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the Raiderettes against the then Oakland Raiders in 2014, alleging wage theft and illegal employment practices. Read MoreIt led to several other cheerleaders following suit, including Maria Pinzone -- a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills and the NFL in 2014. The Raiders settled for $1.25 million in September 2014, paying cheerleaders from 2010 - 2014 what they were owed back in wages. Individual payments ranged from $2,000 to $30,000, depending on the number of seasons the women danced on the team​, according to Sharon R. Vinick, attorney at Levy Vinick Burrell Hyams, who represented the women in the case. Thibodeaux-Fields also received an additional $10,000 for acting as the lead plaintiff. In 2014, after the lawsuit was filed, the Raiders ​reportedly more than doubled the cheerleaders' pay for mandatory events, amounting to about $9 an hour -- minimum wage at the time. CNN Sport reached out to the Las Vegas Raiders, previously the Oakland Raiders, for comment but has yet to receive a reply.  READ: Remembering the forgotten Black heroes of baseballMaria Pinzone filed a lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills in 2014. Meanwhile, Pinzone's case against the Bills is still ongoing, almost seven years after she filed the lawsuit. The film, directed by Yu Gu and which is free to stream on the PBS Video App​, follows both Pinzone and Thibodeaux-Fields as they navigate their legal battles and cope with the fallout of their decision to stand up to ​their teams. Gu ​had no idea the project would last so long when she started it in 2014, but says it's been a window into the immense inequality of the NFL and wider society. "It's really a microcosm into what all women are facing right now in the workplace, battling these stereotypes and these hypocritical standards that we're faced with," Gu, who was born in China and grew up in Canada, told CNN Sport.  "It's definitely looking at something bigger through this very specific lens and even though the main participants, the protagonists, they're women, I think this inequality affects men. "It's that mixture of hypermasculinity and toxic masculinity that is the source of this misogyny but it's also something that affects all genders." Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' She didn't listen.From an early age, Thibodeaux-Fields had dreams of cheerleading for one of football's biggest teams and, after years of hard work, she fulfilled her ambition by joining the Raiderettes cheer team for the then Oakland Raiders.Thibodeaux-Fields had previously danced in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors. She looks back fondly on those two seasons and says she was treated very well. ​However, on joining the Raiderettes, ​she says, things were different. She told CNN Sport she wasn't paid minimum wage for the countless hours she was putting in. There would be multiple community appearances and practice sessions, she said, that were unpaid. Equipment, uniforms and treatments, required to live up to the expected image of a cheerleader, all came out of her own pocket, she told CNN Sport.Raiderettes made just $1,250 per season and pay would come at the very end of the year, Vinick told CNN Sport. Thibodeaux-Fields, who works as a dance teacher, calculated it to be less than the then minimum wage​, given the number of hours she worked. With a young family to support and with her husband questioning the contract she signed, she took advice from a legal expert and, in 2014, filed a lawsuit against the Oakland Raiders alleging wage theft.  "There are lots of jobs that people would do for free, but they shouldn't have to just because it's their passion or their dream," Thibodeaux-Fields told CNN Sport.  "Yes, there are some girls that would probably dance for free, but they're not going to be the caliber of [dancer] that I am. They're not going to have the experience or the drive."That's why I'm here. You pay me for what I'm worth. That's the point I'm making." Vinick told CNN Sport that she was initially shocked when she first read the cheerleaders' contract because "it had more illegal provisions than any contract that I've read in almost 30 years of practicing law." Although she was satisfied with the eventual settlement from a legal standpoint -- securing minimum wages for the Raiderettes -- Vinick says she was left disappointed by the overall outcome."It didn't end up with cheerleaders really being paid their worth. It just ended up with them being paid minimum wage if they continued," she added.  "Instead of arguing about whether these women should be paid minimum wages, we should talk about paying these women their fair worth for what they contribute to the game day experience." READ: Frappart becomes first woman to referee in men's Champions LeagueThibodeaux-Fields is now working as a dance teacher. Like Thibodeaux-Fields, Pinzone told CNN Sport she "worked her butt off" to be selected for the Buffalo Bills' Jills.  She had previously failed twice in her bid to make the team but, on her third attempt, she ​said she was "over the moon" to be chosen. However, things quickly turned sour.  Pinzone says she was expected to spend $650 on her team outfit and a further $500 on treatments to be ready for the team calendar shoot. She would then participate in hours of unpaid appearances, she said, some of which were mandatory, and sponsor events, representing both the NFL and the Bills.  At the time, Pinzone did not want to speak out in case she was kicked off the team and said the subject of money was always too taboo to approach.  "I felt like I was being taken advantage of," she told CNN Sport. "I felt like I was going to these appearances and [...] supporting everything around that, and on the back end of it, somebody else was getting paid for it." 'We should be less afraid to be afraid,' says Emily Harrington after historic El Capitan climbAfter one season, she decided not to go back but still had friends in the team going through similar experiences.  In 2014, Pinzone and five other women also decided to file a lawsuit against her team ​over the way they were paid, a case which later included the NFL (which was named on the contract they signed).​The central legal question in the dispute was if the cheerleaders were properly categorized as independent contractors, who aren't subject to certain regulations like minimum wage, or should have been considered employees.Pinzone and the Jills won a summary judgment affirming their employee status but the case has still not been resolved. Pinzone says the trial has most recently been delayed after one of the defendants filed for bankruptcy, and the Covid-19 pandemic is also complicating proceedings. Stejon Productions, the company managing the Jills, stopped the operation in ​the wake of the lawsuit, and the Bills have been without a cheerleading team ever since. CNN has reached out to the Buffalo Bills and the NFL for comment but has yet to receive a response. CNN has also reached out to the lawyers representing the owner of Stejon Productions for comment but is yet to receive a reply. READ: US Soccer reaches deal with women's national team in fight for equal working conditionsJUST WATCHEDMaking history as the NFL's first male cheerleadersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaking history as the NFL's first male cheerleaders 03:10Gu says the fact that Pinzone's case is still ongoing shows the lack of understanding and the need to speak more about gender pay parity. "It's a little bit disheartening to think they could just say we will pay these women instead of spending so much money on actually battling this case," she said. "[The sport] really needs to look at changing the way they're dealing with the cheerleaders, the way that they're treating them. "Of course, there's a resistance to change. There's a resistance to honest accountability of the wrongdoing and you see that across so many different industries.  "That's why I feel like this film is not only just relevant to cheerleading, you see a lack of accountability across the board." The documentary shows the backlash the women received for speaking out, both from within cheerleading and the wider NFL community. ​They say some current and former cheerleaders ostracized those who backed the lawsuits.Despite the countless days in court and disruption it caused their lives, both women ​say they are proud to have spoken out and encourage others to come forward. However, in hindsight, Thibodeaux-Fields would think twice about ever joining the NFL.  "If I would have seen this documentary before I decided to invest all my time and energy into these auditions, I wouldn't have done it," she told CNN Sport, admitting she misses the feeling of performing on that stage. "I would have taken my talent elsewhere. If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL and I'd probably encourage other girls not to either." For Pinzone, the experience shows the lengths big business will go to save money but hopes the documentary will encourage women from all walks of life to fight for change. "At the end of the day, I think it's about money. I mean, these businesses, they just are so greedy. "They want more and more and more, and they don't care who they put down in the process. I feel like it's just so crazy. It really is."I think [the documentary] is a stepping stone and the more people that come forward about their situation, I think will help everyone in the long run."As of September 2020, 10 of the 26 NFL teams with cheerleading squads have been sued for wage theft, unsafe work conditions, sexual harassment and discrimination, according to the documentary.
879,,(CNN)The Ralph Lauren Corporation is cutting ties with golfer Justin Thomas over his use of a homophobic slur.Thomas apologized for the incident, which occurred at a PGA Tour tournament in Hawaii last Saturday."There's no excuse," Thomas told the Golf Channel in an on-air apology immediately after his round.In a statement, the company said it was discontinuing its sponsorship of Thomas because of his use of the slur, which the company said inconsistent with its values."While we acknowledge that he has apologized and recognizes the severity of his words, he is a paid ambassador of our brand and his actions conflict with the inclusive culture that we strive to uphold," a statement from the corporation said.Read MoreThomas uttered the slur after he missed a par putt during the Sentry Tournament of Champions' third round in Hawaii and his words were caught by television microphones.Justin Thomas apologizes for using 'inexcusable' anti-gay slur"I'm an adult.

880,,(CNN)There's a distance of just over two miles between the Lincoln Memorial and the US Capitol. It was in 1963, on the Lincoln Memorial's steps, that The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told the 250,000 people gathered there: "I have a dream that one day [...] the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight [...] and all flesh shall see it together." Fast forward over a half a century and events at the US Capitol suggest America is still struggling to realize King's dream as outgoing Sen. Kelly Loeffler discovered to her cost.Loeffler is the co-owner of a women's basketball team in the WNBA, The Atlanta Dream, named with a nod to King Jr., the nation's most iconic and revered civil rights activist and his hometown. But in one of 2020's surprise endings, Loeffler's own political dreams were sensationally scuppered by the players of her own sports team, a group of her employees who rose up against her to secure, as MLK would have put it, "the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It's one of the most extraordinary stories of what has been a seismic election season; the triumph of a group of athletes who set out with the intention of doing the right thing, but who, in the end, might also have helped change the course of history. Read MoreElizabeth Williams says she never considered herself to be political; the British-born American basketball player was one of the top picks in the 2015 draft and she's played for the Atlanta Dream since 2016. But for the 27-year-old Williams and her teammates, everything changed in the summer of 2020. "After the brutal killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor," Williams told CNN. "We saw a large shift in the fight for social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. We wanted to feel like our voices were going to be heard." Professional athletes understand all too well the risks associated with making a stand. Colin Kaepernick was frozen out of the NFL after taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016, while in the following year, catcher Bruce Maxwell received numerous death threats for doing the same thing ahead of a Major League Baseball game. But few players, if any, have ever stood in direct opposition to the personal interests and ambitions of their employer. The outgoing Sen. Kelly Loeffler is co-owner of The Atlanta Dream.READ: Megan Rapinoe condemns US Capitol rioters as 'White supremacy mob' The WNBA is well known for its support of social justice causes. Collectively, the players chose to dedicate last season to the memory of Breonna Taylor -- a Black woman who was shot and killed by police in her Kentucky apartment -- and they established their own social justice council."We made sure to support the 'Say Her Name' movement. You know, have Black Lives Matter on the court," Williams said. But then what she describes as "a unique situation" almost stopped them in their tracks.   The co-owner of their team, Loeffler, "openly denounced Black Lives Matter in a letter to our league's commissioner, essentially denouncing Black Lives Matter and the movement and saying that we need to keep politics out of sports."  Loeffler described BLM as a "very divisive organization" which promotes "violence and destruction across the country."The players knew what Loeffler was doing. As one of Georgia's two Republican senators, she was campaigning ahead of the 2020 election and trying to head off the challenge of another Republican, Doug Collins.That meant tacking to the extreme right of the political spectrum, pledging loyalty to US President Donald Trump and throwing out red meat to the party's base. CNN has reached out to Loeffler's team for comment but is yet to receive a response.   Following the decision not to charge any of the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death, NBA star LeBron James tweeted, "The most DISRESPECTED person on earth is THE BLACK WOMAN!"   Asked about her own experience of being a Black woman in America, Williams told CNN that "in addition to sometimes feeling a bit of fear, we often feel unheard. And specifically, as female athletes, we often feel that even more. So, we always find ways to try to speak up for people who often aren't heard." In response to the stance of their team owner, Williams said the players were frustrated, disappointed and confused. "There were definitely a lot of emotions," she explained.  The league told CNN that the demographic composition of the WNBA is 80% persons of color, some of whom, Williams said, have "lost family members to gun violence, have felt a lot of this in a very personal way." Some were furious. Before the decision not to charge officers involved in Taylor's shooting was made, the players' union, the WNBPA, tweeted "E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!" over Loeffler's opposition to the WNBA's support for the BLM message while Dream guard Renee Montgomery posted that she was "pretty sad to see that my team ownership is not supportive of the movement & all that it stands for. I was already sitting out this season & this is an example of why." Montgomery was on a sabbatical to focus on social justice reform. Elizabeth Williams posted this photo to Instagram, posing with fellow WNBA stars. READ: 'If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL'There were calls for Loeffler to stand down and a team statement on July 10, signed by all the players, read: "We are the women of the Atlanta Dream. We are women who support a movement. We are strong and we are fearless. We offer a voice to the voiceless. Our team is united in the Movement for Black Lives. It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity. Black Lives Matter." Throughout the course of the interview with Williams, it became apparent that she hadn't once mentioned Loeffler by name. "People in politics talked about the power of saying someone's name," she said. "And so you can also do the opposite by not saying someone's name." The name they chose to say instead was Reverend Raphael Warnock, a Democratic challenger to Loeffler who was a long shot in the senate race, polling in single digits among registered voters in July, according to Monmouth University Poll. But at the start of August, without saying another word to criticize their owner Loeffler, Dream players began publicly supporting her political rival.   "We wanted to react in a way that was still so classy and still promoted what we want to promote," said Williams. It was a plan of action that had the support of players across the league and soon many of them were wearing t-shirts bearing the simple message "Vote Warnock."   Posing in the t-shirt that same day, Williams tweeted, "We are WNBA players, but like the late, great John Lewis said, we are also ordinary people with extraordinary vision."  Suddenly, Warnock's campaign was receiving national attention, players were endorsing him in media interviews and donations were rolling in from well beyond the Georgia borders. Warnock's campaign reportedly said that within just two days of the players getting involved, $200,000 was pledged and the volume of individual donors soared.  The surge of support enabled him to invest in more campaign advertisements and helped increase his campaign's momentum.  Speaking about the players' support, Warnock told USA Today: "I think it was helpful. It was one of the many turning points in the campaign. It gave people a chance to look a little closer and say, 'Who is this Warnock guy and what is he about?'"  From meager polling numbers of 9% in July, Warnock had climbed to 21% in September, according to the Monmouth University Poll, and two months later, he finished first in the election with 32.9%.READ: LeBron talks to his children about the double standard of the US Capitol riotsWilliams says she often feels "unheard" as a Black woman. Because state rules dictated that the winner would have needed to clear 50%, Warnock then lined up in a head-to-head runoff against Loeffler, who finished second in the November race with 25.9% of the vote. On January 5, in a one-on-one election, Warnock became Georgia's first-ever Black US senator and also the first Black Democratic US senator from a southern state.  By this point, though, his victory was even more significant. A quirk of fate meant that the two runoff elections in Georgia could hand the Democrats control of the Senate for the first time in six years. Warnock's win, paired with Jon Ossoff's success in the other race, has made President-elect Joe Biden's task of governing considerably easier than it might otherwise have been. Just as Warnock's election was historically significant, so, too, was Ossoff's; he's the first Jewish person that Georgia has sent to the Senate.  As news of Warnock's triumph became clear, text group chats among Atlanta players and their counterparts across the league began lighting up. Williams says she found it hard to sleep. "Wow, we really did this! We helped flip the Senate," she recalled. "A lot of the messages were just being thankful for being a part of this group of really, really impactful and incredible women.   "You feel all the emotions; the pride, the joy and then the optimism. A lot of what we've seen politically has been surrounded in division and hate, and I think in this moment in particular, it was a moment to be hopeful." 'A blow to the heart,' says LeBron James after officers involved in shooting of Jacob Blake will not face chargesThe joy was short-lived, though. Within hours of Warnock's victory being confirmed, an angry mob had stormed the Capitol in Washington DC. An insurrection inspired by President Trump, left five people dead -- including a Capitol policeman. A despicable "Camp Auschwitz" sweatshirt was seen in the Capitol and the divisive Confederate flag (a relic of the Civil War and a modern-day symbol of racism) was paraded there for the first time in the history of the United States.  Williams, who's now playing basketball in Turkey, says she was disappointed and frustrated, though not necessarily surprised, and felt helpless and embarrassed by the scenes playing out on TV.   "Often in the history of America, we're in this juxtaposition of something really good happening and something bad. You know, like the fact that the [Georgia Senate runoff] election was the same day that we got the news that the officer that shot Jacob Blake wouldn't be charged."  Despite all the progress that has been made, Williams says that "we do always have to be aware and have to be accountable for a grave history of White supremacy and fear."  Williams says the experience of the last year has changed her mindset forever. "Yeah, I guess I'm a little more political now," she reflected. "I think I always paid attention to these things, but I always felt like, 'Well, you know, somebody else will do it.' But I've grown into stepping out and trying to be a leader in these moments."  As MLK himself said: "A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true."
881,,(CNN)Should this NFL game be shown as a live broadcast or on the History Channel?That's the question that's been put to Tom Brady and Drew Brees ahead of their meeting in the NFL playoffs this Sunday, the first postseason game in NFL history to feature two opposing starting quadragenarian quarterbacks.The 43-year-old Brady tweeted a "History Awaits" picture ahead of the clash, while 42-year-old Brees gave it a thumbs up, saying: "This is good!"https://t.co/kvv2dNTmHS pic.twitter.com/ND8nmGmZG7— Tom Brady (@TomBrady) January 12, 2021 The combined age of these legends of the sport -- they occupy the top two spots in nearly all quarterback records -- will be 85 years and 169 days old on Sunday when the New Orleans Saints host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Divisional playoffs.That's the oldest combined age of opposing starting quarterbacks in a single game -- regular-season or postseason -- in league annals.Read MoreBrady joked that he will have to overcome an age difference with Brees if he wants to win on Sunday."He's a lot younger than me," Brady told the media.

And if they are to advance to the next round of the playoffs, the Buccaneers will have to defeat the Saints in Louisiana as well.The last game between the NFL teams ended in a resounding 38-3 win for the Saints, but that was over two months ago and, in that time, Brady believes the Buccaneers have "certainly come a long way."Brady warms up before playing against the Washington Football Team in the playoffs."I think we're just going to keep improving," the six-time Super Bowl champion said."The more we're together, the more we're talking about football, the more we're trying to be on the same page, the better it is.

884,,(CNN)Preparations for the Australian Open hit a major stumbling block on Saturday after 47 players were told they couldn't train or practice after some passengers on two charter planes arriving in Melbourne returned positive Covid-19 test results.Twenty-four players on a charter flight from the US to Melbourne are required to quarantine for two weeks after a member of the flight crew and a passenger -- not a player -- tested positive. Both had tested negative within 72 hours of boarding the flight, which carried a total of 79 people.Another 23 players are also in quarantine following the arrival in Melbourne of a charter flight carrying 64 people from Abu Dhabi. One person -- again not a player -- tested positive after the flight, despite presenting documentation of a negative Covid-19 test prior to takeoff.All 47 players affected will not be able to leave their hotel rooms for the 14-day period and until they are medically cleared. They will not be eligible to practice.Australian Open organizers released two statements on Saturday detailing how the players would be affected.Read More"All passengers from the flight are already in quarantine hotels and the positive case, who is not a player and had tested negative before the flight, has been transferred to a health hotel," said the second statement in reference to the Abu Dhabi-Melbourne flight.The passengers who tested positive for the virus on the US flight were also transferred to a health hotel."Our thoughts are with the two people who tested positive on the flight and we wish them well for their recovery," said Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley in the organizers' first statement.JUST WATCHEDPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennis 05:30READ: Tennys Sandgren tests positive for Covid-19 then boards plane to Australian Open'Rigorous testing schedule'In a tweet that was subsequently deleted, French player Alize Cornet, who is in Melbourne but was not on either plane, described the situation as "insane.""Soon, half of the players from the AO will actually have to isolate," she tweeted.

885,,(CNN)More than a hundred people were arrested in Brussels on Wednesday night after violent protests over the death of a man in police custody. The Brussels prosecutor's office said Wednesday it had opened an investigation into "involuntary manslaughter" after a 23-year-old Black man lost consciousness at a police station shortly after being arrested. He later died in hospital.Hundreds of protestors gathered in Liedts square in central Brussels. Video from the scene showed scuffles as demonstrators threw stones and projectiles while police deployed a water cannon.Some demonstrators carried Black Lives Matter signs and shouted, "We want the truth."Belgian King Philippe's car was "briefly stuck" nearby, the palace told CNN, and the vehicle was hit by a few projectiles thrown at police officers surrounding the monarch's convoy. Read MoreThe King himself was not the target and "his security was never endangered," they said.The protest in Brussels was largely peaceful, before some violent clashes in the evening.A death in police custodyThe death that precipitated Wednesday's protests occurred on Saturday, after police "checked" a group of people who had assembled in spite of coronavirus measures that limit public gatherings, a statement from the prosecutor's office said.A man -- identified as Ibrahima B. by the lawyer representing his family -- "fled on foot and was taken in for questioning by police," according to the prosecutor's statement."When he arrived at the police station, I.B. lost consciousness and the police officers present called the emergency services. An ambulance and an emergency team arrived at the scene and I.B. was taken to hospital. He died in hospital at 8:22 pm," the statement added.Speaking at a demonstration over his death on Wednesday, the family's lawyer Alexis Deswaef told Belgian television, "I know one thing -- if that was my son, who's white and the same age, that would not have happened."Deswaef told CNN that "the family was told that their son had a cardiac abnormality" but that this "would not be the sole cause of the death."Toxicology tests "show traces of narcotics," the lawyer added, but these "would not explain the death."The escorted official car of Belgium's King Philippe makes a turn to avoid protestors.Responding to the protests, General Commissary of the Federal Police Marc De Mesmaeker on Thursday said, "We can understand that emotions are running high... but the way in which this was done is completely unacceptable."He accused protesters of committing acts of "vandalism" and said five police officers were wounded in the unrest.Belgian Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said Wednesday on Twitter: "We cannot in any way accept what happened today ... The rioters will not get away with impunity."

888,,(CNN)A British man who accidentally threw a hard drive loaded with bitcoin into the trash has offered the local authority where he lives more than $70 million if it allows him to excavate a landfill site. IT worker James Howells got rid of the drive, which held a digital store of 7,500 bitcoins, between June and August in 2013. He had originally mined the virtual currency four years earlier when it was of little value. But when the cryptocurrency shot up in value and he went in search of it, he discovered that he had mistakenly thrown the hard drive out with the trash. Bitcoin prices roar back towards $40,000Now, with his lost bitcoin having soared even further, Howells has approached Newport City Council in Wales to ask for permission to dig a specific section of the landfill site where he believes the hard drive ended up. In return, he has offered to pay the council a quarter of the current value of the hoard, which he says could be distributed to local residents. Read MoreThe digital currency was created in 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are essentially computer files that are stored in a "digital wallet" on your device. They can then be used as payment, with every transaction being recorded in a public list known as blockchain. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high in recent days and is now trading around $37,000.Bitcoin rally may be the 'mother of all bubbles' says BofAHowells first discovered that the hard drive was missing when his bitcoin was worth around $9 million. Based on the current rates, he estimates it would be worth around $273 million.  He told CNN: "I offered to donate 25% or £52.5 million ($71.7 million) to the city of Newport in order to distribute to all local residents who live in Newport should I find and recover the bitcoins.""This would work out to approx £175 ($239) per person for the entire city (316k population). Unfortunately they refused the offer and won't even have a face to face discussion with me on the matter."After discovering the mistake, Howells went to the garbage dump to see where the hard drive might have ended up. He told CNN at the time: "As soon as I saw the site, I thought you've got no chance. The area covered is huge."How Bitcoin is making waves in the luxury market However, he now believes he knows how to retrieve it.  "The plan would be to dig a specific area of the landfill based on a grid reference system and recover the hard drive whilst adhering to all safety and environmental standards," he told CNN Friday. "The drive would then be presented to data recovery specialists who can rebuild the drive from scratch with new parts and attempt to recover the tiny piece of data that I need in order to access the bitcoins.""The value of the hard drive is over £200m (around $273 million) and I'm happy to share a portion of that with the people of Newport should I be given the opportunity to search for it. Approximately 50% would be for investors who put up the capital to fund the project, and I would be left with the remaining 25%," he added.Cryptocurrency tycoon died leaving $145m in limbo. Now lawyers seek exhumation to check it's really him A spokeswoman for Newport City Council told CNN that the local government authority had been "contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins."In a statement sent to CNN, the spokeswoman said the council had not refused the offer -- but rather, was not permitted to excavate the site. She said: "The council has told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licencing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area."The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds -- without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order."
889,,(CNN)James Naismith, the Canadian-American who invented the game of basketball, was celebrated with a Google Doodle on Friday.Naismith, who invented the sport in 1891, was born 30 years earlier, near the town of Almonte in Ontario, Canada.He didn't invent the game in Ontario, that would come when he was a physical education teacher at what is now Springfield College in Massachusetts.There is believed to be the only one audio recording of Naismith, which was discovered by University of Kansas professor.The interview took place in New York on January 31, 1939, just months before Naismith died that November, aged 78.Read MoreNaismith was in New York to attend a basketball doubleheader at Madison Square Garden, 48 years after he created the very game that he was watching.Naismith said it all began in the winter of 1891, when he was a physical education teacher. "We had a real New England blizzard," Naismith said. "For days, the students couldn't go outdoors, so they began roughhousing in the halls. We tried everything to keep them quiet. We tried playing a modified form of football in the gymnasium, but they got bored with that. Something had to be done."Then one day, Naismith got an idea. At each end of the gym, Naismith nailed up two peach baskets. He called the students to the gym and split them into teams of nine and gave them an old soccer ball and told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket."I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began," Naismith said.However, there was a major problem. Naismith didn't have enough rules for his new game, and he said that's where he made his big mistake."The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches," Naismith said. "They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. Before I could pull them apart, one boy was knocked out, several of them had black eyes, and one had a dislocated shoulder. It certainly was murder."But the students nagged at Naismith to let them play again. So he made up some more rules, which included one that he deemed the most important: no running with the ball."That stopped tackling and slugging," Naismith said. "We tried out the game with those rules, and we didn't have one casualty. We had a fine, clean sport."JUST WATCHEDThe Lakers hid Kobe tributes in their championship ringReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Lakers hid Kobe tributes in their championship ring 01:37READ: LeBron hits no-look three pointer to win mid-game betREAD: Legacy of MLK's 'I have a dream' speech becomes a nightmare for Atlanta sports team owner Ten years later, Naismith said, basketball was being played all over the country.

890,,(CNN)The Dutch government has resigned amid a scandal that saw thousands of families wrongly accused of child welfare fraud. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the Cabinet's resignation in an address Friday, saying that responsibility for the scandal "ultimately rests with the incumbent Cabinet and nowhere else."Under the scandal, around 10,000 families in the Netherlands were told to repay tens of thousands of euros of subsidies after being wrongly accused of child welfare fraud. Rutte made his speech in the aftermath of the publication of a report by the Parliamentary Interrogation Committee on Childcare Allowance, which he called "very tough, but fair.""On all levels throughout the political-administrative-legal system, mistakes have been made that have resulted in great injustice to thousands of parents," he remarked.Read MoreDutch king cuts short vacation in Greece after criticismThe Dutch premier was clear that financial compensation for the affected parents is the "the first thing that needs to be properly arranged.""We will continue to work on quick compensation and the improvements needed for the future."Elections for a new government will take place in mid-March he announced, saying that until then, the current administration will stay on and "can be expected to do what is necessary in the national interest."Rutte has been in power for over a decade, taking charge in October 2010. If his party wins the election in two months, he will be able to form a new administration.Addressing the Dutch people, Rutte said "our fight against the coronavirus continues."
891,,London (CNN)Ella is now working from home. She joins many around the world, fellow Brits -- and her parents -- in succumbing to safety over normalcy. She is 12 years old, a high school student in south London.12-year-old Ella, perhaps like most children, was excited at first about not going to school. Now, she just wants to get back."When I was in Year Seven and the first lockdown came, we were like, 'Oh my gosh, this is so good! We don't have to go to school!'" she said from her dining room, via Zoom. "And now I'm just like, 'Oh please let me go back to school.'"As in much of Europe, the British government has made face-to-face learning a priority in the pandemic. Apart from the first lockdown in spring 2020, it had managed to keep schools open through the autumn. That was done, despite, at times, shutting all non-essential retail and restaurants and telling people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary.When CNN visited Ella's school before the December holiday break, we saw the measures used to keep teachers and children safe. Masks were mandatory outside the classroom. Each class was a bubble, able to be sent home as a group if anyone tested positive. And the school administration devoted significant resources to trace possible cases. Read MoreSudden changesFor weeks leading up to the New Year, despite surging coronavirus cases and a new highly contagious variant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government assured schools and parents that children would return to the classroom in January.On the morning of January 4, as children streamed into schools and he toured a hospital, Johnson touted "the efforts that we're making as a government to try to keep primary schools open."Just hours later, he executed an about-face of acrobatic proportions. In a somber prime-time address to the nation, the Prime Minister said that he was ordering the closure, from the next day, of not just secondary schools -- which serve children 11 and above and are where spread is more likely -- but also primary, or elementary schools.Head teacher Julia Waters says she now wants teachers vaccinated before they return to the classroom."It was inevitable," Julia Waters, head teacher of Ella's Ursuline High School, told CNN. "Obviously they hadn't listened to head teachers' voices."Indeed, the government's official scientific advisory panel concluded before Christmas that it was "highly unlikely" that the government could get a handle on the new highly contagious variant of coronavirus that has ripped through England as long as schools remained open.Waters agrees there is no true substitute for face-to-face learning, but said she was furious with the government's lack of decisiveness. She wants her teachers vaccinated before they return to the classroom.Europe has kept its schools open for much of the pandemic. Now closures loomAnd yet, as England remains in strict lockdown, it is still Johnson's goal to open schools "as soon as possible," he told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.He has support in that goal from Amanda Spielman, the chief regulator for schools in England, who told CNN last month that remote learning is "nothing like the same as actual schooling.""It's not just children with obvious disadvantage markers or children who don't have laptops or good internet access at home," she said. "There are real problems with motivation. There are real problems for younger children trying to learn through screens. We can see effects across the board."Research shows children's cases follow adult infectionsScientists now agree that while children are much less susceptible to illness from the coronavirus, they can spread it. But research conducted during England's last lockdown in November, suggests that schools do not play a big role in amplifying outbreaks -- they simply reflect the contagion already present in their community.England closed down shops, bars, restaurants and tourist attractions while keeping schools open in 2020. But in the latest lockdown, schoold for all ages have shut as well."When you look at the data, what you do see is that there is a lag in school-age children compared to adults," Shamez Ladhani, the lead author of preliminary research published in the Lancet medical journal in December, told CNN regarding new coronavirus infections. "When adult rates start going up, children's rates start going up. And during the lockdown, when adult rates came down, it took a week, but children's rates started going down as well. So, there is a very close correlation."The spread of coronavirus in England is now worse than it has ever been during the pandemic. Policymakers and scientists alike are grasping for any tool in their kit to reduce interaction. But when the contagion stabilizes, as they hope, schools may be the first to benefit.CNN's Max Foster contributed to this story.
892,,Rome (CNN)Pope Francis and former Pope Benedict have received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the Vatican said Thursday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that he was "able to confirm that within the vaccine program of the Vatican City State, to this date the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine has been administered to Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus."The statement did not say when 84-year-old Pope Francis or his 93-year-old predecessor were inoculated. Vatican City began its vaccine program on Wednesday in a medical center set-up inside its main Auditorium Hall, where the pontiff often holds his weekly audiences. Both men are at higher risk of contracting the virus because of their age.  In recent weeks, Francis has spoken several times on the subject of vaccines. Over the weekend, he said people have an "ethical duty" to take the vaccine and confirmed he was in line to receive one once the Vatican's vaccination program got underway. "I believe that ethically everyone should take the vaccine. It is not an option, it is an ethical choice because you are gambling with your health, with your life, but you are also gambling with the lives of others," the pontiff said in an interview with Italy's Canale 5 channel broadcast on Sunday night. Read MorePope criticizes people going on holiday to avoid Covid-19 lockdownsHe also used his Christmas message to ask countries to share vaccines, adding that "they must be available to everyone.""I beg all those in charge of states, of companies, of international bodies ... to promote cooperation and not competition and to seek a solution for everyone, vaccines for all, especially for the most vulnerable and needy in all regions of the globe," the Pope said during his traditional Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message at the Vatican.Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI speaks to Pope Francis at a ceremony at the Vatican in 2015. On Saturday, the Vatican's newspaper L'Osservatore Romano announced Francis' personal doctor, Fabrizio Soccorsi, had died as a result of "complications due to Covid."Francis chose Soccorsi as his personal doctor in 2015, the news outlet said.  Soccorsi, 78, was hospitalized in a Rome on December 26 for a previous oncological disease, according to the Italian Bishop's Conference newspaper Avvenire.

A new, more infectious variant of Covid-19, which officials say is out of control, has caused record-breaking infection rates.And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the country's intensive care units (ICUs) face substantial risk of being overwhelmed by the disease, which has infected more than 3.2 million people and killed 84,000.The patients are in the final days of their isolation period and need minimal care.Hospital beds are now one of the most precious commodities in the country, but so far, there are only three patients recovering on the first floor of the otherwise empty hotel.Hoteliers say they want health officials to send hundreds more Covid-19 patients their way."The hospitality industry is virtually closed, so we are all willing to open our doors and get ill people better as soon as possible," Meher Nawab, the CEO of the London Hotel Group, of which Best Western is a part, explained.There are no medical workers at the hotel in Croydon to support the patients, all of whom are in the final days of their isolation period and need minimal care.Travel to the UK during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go"Myself and my staff, we are very confident that everything will run smoothly and that we created a safe environment for our staff and also for these early discharge patients," Palaghiu explained.Contactless meal delivery takes place three times a day, and phones are manned 24/7 in case of any emergencies.Staff completed a video training course provided by the NHS, stepped-up their hygiene practices, and installed air filtration systems throughout the building."The feeling is that we are not scared," Palaghiu said when asked if he and his staff were reluctant to take in Covid patients."We are properly trained and the cleaning standard is higher than ever. So we are confident."The 4-star hotel is just around the corner from a major hospital and staff here say they are desperate to provide some reprieve for the overwhelmed doctors and nurses.Nearly half of ICU staff in the UK were found to exhibit signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to a study conducted in the summer of 2020 by Kings College London. Some of those surveyed experienced thoughts of self-harm, while others had turned to alcohol abuse.Staff completed an NHS training course and installed air filtration systems.The bosses of this hotel brand say they are in touch with NHS leadership on a daily basis and hope to see their spare rooms fill up in coming days."Through Best Western we have an excess of 5,000 hotel rooms available. A number of other (hotel) brands have approached us and we could within weeks get 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 hotel rooms opened to assist the NHS," Nawab said.As cases rise in the UK, health officials may soon take up that offer.CNN's Nada Bashir and Sarah Dean contributed reporting

895,,London (CNN)When pharmacist Ifeoma Onwuka, known to her friends as Laura, went into hospital to have her daughter, she and her husband hoped the delivery would go smoothly, and that they would soon be able to take their new arrival home  to meet her siblings.   Onwuka's labor was induced at James Paget University Hospital in Great Yarmouth in the UK, about 140 miles northeast of London, in late April 2018. Things progressed quickly and there were soon signs that her baby was in distress, causing staff to begin preparations for an emergency Caesarian section, but Onwuka's daughter was born in the recovery room. 'The greatest trick racism ever pulled was convincing England it doesn't exist'Shortly after the birth, Onwuka's condition began to deteriorate, according to the family's lawyer, Tim Deeming; she began to bleed heavily, and was taken into surgery where attempts were made to stem the loss of blood. Hours later, and only after a second consultant had been called in, she was given an emergency hysterectomy. The mother-of-three died three days later. The coroner, Yvonne Blake, said an expert had told Onwuka's inquest that the delay to surgery contributed to her death, since acting early could have controlled the bleeding. Black mothers have worse outcomes during pregnancy or childbirth than any other ethnic group in England. According to the latest confidential inquiry into maternal deaths ​(MBRRACE-UK), released Thursday, Black people in England are four times more likely to die in pregnancy or within the first six weeks of childbirth than their White counterparts.  JUST WATCHEDFighting for Black Lives Matter in rural BritainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFighting for Black Lives Matter in rural Britain 05:08Read MoreDeeming said Onwuka had been considered a high-risk patient because of her age -- she was 37; her ethnicity -- she was a Black British citizen, who was born in Nigeria; and because she had lost twins during a previous pregnancy.   Onwuka was found to have developed an amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), a catastrophic complication of pregnancy in which amniotic fluid or other debris enters the mother's bloodstream, Deeming said. This can lead to fatal reactions, including cardiac arrest or excessive bleeding. According to one study, those from "Black or other minority ethnic groups" are more likely to die or have permanent neurological injury from the condition. Blake took the step of issuing the hospital and the General Medical Council with a "report to prevent future deaths" over the handling of her care, warning of "a lack of leadership and overview on Ms. Onwuka's care." Europe's social safety net is often considered the gold standard. Coronavirus has exposed its holesDeeming said that: "Even though AFE is a rare condition, there are national guidelines and all hospitals should have clear plans and training in place for such situations given the data." For example, Blake discovered that there did not need to be two consultants present to conduct the hysterectomy that could have saved Onwuka's life.  "How can we prevent this happening to another family when we know that ethnicity and the other risk factors mean [AFE complications]... can be prevented," Deeming asked. The family is waiting for a response from the hospital. In a statement to CNN, the hospital said it had been "greatly saddened by the death of Mrs Onwuka, and we would like to offer our sincerest condolences to her family for their loss."  "As there is an ongoing legal claim, we are not able to comment further at this time," it added.Ongoing disparityTinuke Awe (left) and Clotilde Rebecca Abe (right), founded FivexMore to improve maternal healthcare outcomes for Black women.The MBBRACE-UK​ report, which charts maternal deaths in England found that between 2016 and 2018, maternal death rates were 34 per 100,000 among Black women, compared to eight per 100,000 among White women, 15 per 100,000 Asian women and 25 per 100,000 mixed race women. Such differences have existed since MBBRACE began tracking maternal deaths in 2014, covering the 2009 to 2012 period, and likely long before. The improvement since ​2019's report, which showed Black people were five times more likely to die during childbirth, provides little solace for campaigners, who say research or targets designed to help solve the problem remain near non-existent.   From the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirus"Health professionals were aware of this for a long time, yet the conversation on disparity was not happening in the public sphere," said Tinuke Awe, co-founder of the campaign group FivexMore, which was named after the disparity highlighted in a 2018 MBRRACE report, and is calling on the government to improve maternal healthcare outcomes for Black women.   The issue gained prominence last June, when Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters demanded a reckoning for racial injustices, at a time when Black people and members of other minority ethnic groups were being disproportionately affected by Covid-19 .    In September, opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to commit to an investigation into Black maternal mortality -- saying it was an example of the structural inequalities that "sadly persist" in the UK.  Constellation of biases  The outcomes for Black people are similar in the US.  In 2018, Black people in the US were three times more likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth than their White or Hispanic counterparts, with a maternal death rate of 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  UK opposition leader Keir Starmer called for an investigation into why outcomes were so bad for Black parents.Experts have noted that the racial disparity in maternal deaths in the US remains, regardless of the mother's income and education level. There is no simple answer for why such inequality exists in the UK, according to Marian Knight, the MBBRACE report co-author and professor of maternal and child population health at the University of Oxford.  "Potentially, one of the explanations is that there is a constellation of biases," from structural biases around ethnicity, to a lack of culturally appropriate care, or, in some cases, complicating factors around immigration status.   On top of that, she said: "You've got the added bias of being female," since women's healthcare and research is not as well funded as other areas.  Black employees earn 20% less at Britain's biggest bank. It's trying to fix thatThe MBBRACE report does not look into specific causes of maternal death according to ethnic groups, which campaigners say makes it harder to pinpoint why the death rate for Black people is so much higher.  "There are too many different reasons and we don't even know why -- we need to get to that point," said Awe from FivexMore.  Knight said more research was being done, but that pregnancy research in general is underfunded and research gaps on Black female health outcomes in the UK are a reflection of structural biases faced by those working in obstetrics.  ​Another reason may be that Black ​people are more likely to develop conditions such as high blood pressure, or to be obese than other ethnic groups. Obesity increases a ​person's risk of developing complications during pregnancy, including high-blood pressure and pre-eclampsia.  Social determinants  The differences in overall health and chronic illnesses between Black and White parents does not adequately explain the high proportion of poor outcomes, say some health practitioners. Social determinants such as implicit biases, socioeconomic status, a person's physical environment, or levels of stress, also play a part.  A lot of conditions could be driven by social determinants, Hannah King, a midwife who is part of the Midwives Against Racism collective, told CNN.  She noted the "weathering hypothesis," published in 1992  in the National Library of Medicine​, which described conditions faced by Black Americans. It proposes that racial disparities could be bad for one's health -- that social and economic disadvantage can lead to an earlier onset of disease and other health problems, she says. The US has the highest maternal death rate of any developed nation. California is trying to do something about thatThese disadvantages can include living in poverty or even one's immigration status -- affecting groups like asylum seekers and migrant women who are considered a high-risk for pregnancy-related death, Rosalind Bragg, the Director of UK charity Maternity Action, told CNN. The annual MBRRACE report does not include details on the immigration status of the non-UK citizens who died. But according to the latest report, the highest proportion of deaths among non-UK citizens came from people born in Africa (36%). The overall maternal death rate for those born in the UK was 8 out of 100,000 mothers. That rate was 7 out of 100,000 for mothers born in Nigeria, 27 out of 100,000 for mothers born in Bangladesh and 49 out 100,000 for mothers born in India. The British government has introduced fees ​for some migrants accessing NHS services. Even though the law says women should not be refused maternity care, the charges -- part of what is known as the "hostile environment" for asylum seekers and migrants -- effectively deter them from attending ​maternity care, Bragg said.  It is a view shared by Knight, who says sometimes hospitals are unable to address the specific needs of the vulnerable -- such as lacking an interpreter for those who do not speak English -- which could lead to them dying from preventable causes. This year's MBRRACE report notes that a number of women who died "were Black or other minority ethnicity women who did not have English as a first language." The language barrier "seems to have been magnified as the women became more unwell, because of their inability to express themselves or misinterpretation by healthcare workers of different cultural expressions of illness," it added. The issue gained more prominence last June, when BLM protesters demanded a reckoning for racial injustices. A growing body of US research suggests the biases of health professionals play a further role in these bad statistics. Studies have shown that Black patients are in some situations prescribed less pain medication than their White counterparts. And a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed unequal treatment in part to "enduring racist cultural beliefs and practices." In the UK, a 2013 study found minority women reporting a poorer overall experience of maternity care compared to White women. Racial bias "both implicit or unconscious and unintentional, can hinder medical consultations, [and] negatively influence treatment options," ultimately resulting in Black women avoiding treatment," Dr. Christine Ekechi, an obstetrician and ​co-chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' race equality taskforce, told CNN in a statement. The newspaper that gave Black Britain a megaphoneThat's a view shared by Sandra Igwe, founder of UK social enterprise the Motherhood Group, who says she has heard a number of "horror stories" of Black people struggling to be heard or believed while receiving care.  During the birth ​of her first child, Igwe said she felt she was callously treated by midwives even though she told them repeatedly that she was in agonizing pain from her contractions. At one point she said she began vomiting, but "all I could remember was that they were more frustrated with me for expressing my agony," she said.  ​Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, NHS England's Chief Midwifery Officer, told Parliament last July that the NHS had much to do "in relation to stereotyping," adding that "every health professional [should] think about unconscious bias and think how that might influence the consultation with women and their families."   King says those biases exist right from the beginning of doctors' training, in medical school, where "everything is on White mannequins or textbooks or White patients, so you can't recognize things like low blood oxygen saturations or cyanosis on darker skin tones," she said.   No targets  While giving evidence, Dunkley-Bent told the parliamentary committee that there is no national target to reduce the poor maternal outcomes for Black women. When asked by CNN why no such targets had been set, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: "We have launched a new oversight group to monitor how the health service is tackling maternal inequalities." The film and TV industry has got Black characters wrong for decades. Meet the Black British creatives rewriting the script.They added that: "No woman should have to worry that the color of their skin will impact their pregnancy and we are taking steps to make sure Black and ethnic minority women get the right support and best possible maternity care." But change is not happening fast enough, say campaigners.  Knight, the report's co-author, pointed out that for every death, there are 100 more women who are severely ill.  "I just don't feel like enough is being done," Awe said. "I now have a daughter, I've got friends, I've got sisters, I've got people I care about who will one day [have children]. Just by virtue of being Black, are they more likely to die?"
896,,(CNN)Wearing nothing but a bathing suit, a swimming cap and an underwater mask, the 40-year-old woman plunged into a carved-out section of a frozen Siberian lake, before diving under the ice to swim in water estimated to be around 32 degrees Fahrenheit.Footage tweeted by the English language Siberian Times shows the 40-year-old woman from Moscow entering the carved-out section of a frozen Lake Baikal, before she started the underwater ice swim.Yekaterina Nekrasova, who took up free diving four years ago, then held her breath for a minute and a half as she covered the 85 meters (279 feet) of a frozen Lake Baikal on January 7 -- the Russian Orthodox Christmas Day.She is believed to have set a world record with her attempt. A spokeswoman for Guinness World Records told CNN they have received details of Nekrasova's attempt but have yet to verify the landmark swim. Nekrasova swam 85 meters (279 feet) under a layer of ice in Siberia.Footage filmed from above the surface shows members of her support team following behind in wet suits, in case of emergency. According to the Siberian Times, holes were cut in the 10-inch-thick ice at regular intervals in case she needed to abort the swim.Read MoreThe challenge was filmed from both above and beneath the surface. Nekrasova can be seen descending a ladder, then following a route marked by a cable for a minute and a half. At the end she exits the water by climbing up another ladder.

The 85m breaststroke swim in Lake Baikal took 1.5 min; holes were cut in the 10-inch thick ice at regular intervals in case she needed to abort the swim pic.twitter.com/ya2fD1ImMF— The Siberian Times (@siberian_times) January 11, 2021 Lake Baikal holds several global records itself. Somewhere between 20 and 25 million years old, it is the oldest existing freshwater lake on Earth. Reaching down as far as 5,315 feet, it is the deepest continental body of water, as well as being the world's largest freshwater lake by volume -- it holds about one-fifth of the fresh water on Earth's surface, some 5,500 cubic miles. Posting on Russian social network site VK, Nekrasova said the original plan was to swim on January 6 but "extreme weather" -- including a "very strong frost" and stormy winds -- delayed it. The swimmer held her breath for a minute and a half as she covered the 279-foot distance.While she knew that she could "comfortably" swim 75 meters (246 feet), Nekrasova said doubts began to creep in."I thought what if I would freeze before the start, or the mask would freeze or fog up, or I would stick to the ice at the finish line. And of course I didn't know how long I could dive in a new place," she wrote.  A climate activist swam under the Antarctic ice sheet to prove how quickly glaciers are meltingThe air temperature was as low as -22 degrees Fahrenheit but felt more like -43.6 on January 6, she said. Conditions were "dangerous and dark under the ice," which convinced the team to postpone the attempt.Nekrasova described what happened the following day as a "Christmas miracle." "The weather warmed up to -21 (degrees Celsius, -5.8 Fahrenheit ), the wind slightly moderated," she wrote. As her support team prepared the site with safety lanes and holes in the ice, she remained at her hotel.Nekrasova took up free diving four years ago.Having warmed up, she made her way to the starting point, where she was joined by her support team."For a minute I stood dressed in front of the ladder, tuned in, breathing, the wind was strong. I put on a mask, undressed and hurried into the water. There is no wind, no frost, no fear in the water and it is very comfortable. I stood for about 30 seconds until the pulse calmed down. Then I dived."Ice swimming embraced by people of happiest country in the worldDescribing the experience as a "pleasure," said she "enjoyed the process" and that ultimately she was "overwhelmed with emotions."Signing off, she added: "The powerful energy of this place helped me. Thank you Baikal! Until next time!"Ice swimming, or epiphany bathing, is a tradition in Russia. For many Orthodox Christians, it is part of a January ritual commemorating the baptism of Jesus.Nekrasova, who trains four times a week in a warm pool and dives twice in a week in ice holes in Moscow, told CNN: "For me, under-ice diving is like an energy boost, as if I was reborn. It is a sensation I can't compare to anything else, a very pleasant one. And I always long for it."Lake Baikal is somewhere between 20 and 25 million years old and is the oldest existing freshwater lake on Earth. Ram Barkai, the founder of the International Ice Swimming Association, told CNN he and a team of four Russian ice swimmers covered an above-surface "ice mile" in Lake Baikal at 40.1 degrees Fahrenheit back in 2017. By comparison, Nekrasova is a free diver -- which means she held her breath for the duration of the swim at close to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, under a sheet of ice.He said: "The water there is as fresh as one can get -- salinity of zero. Meaning you are heavier in the water and you feel the cold a little more than in salt water. "It is a magical place, Lake Baikal. The water visibility is also amazing, crystal clear water and you can see forever. That is a good factor for safety."Ice swim racing is not for the faint of heart -- literallyOf Nekrasova's achievement, he said: "The water should have been close to zero, which makes it extremely hard on your muscles. She swam without any assistance -- gliding very efficiently. It was amazing to watch her."Eighty-five meters is a very long distance in warm water with no ice sheet above your head. Although she had a line to show her direction and distance, she wasn't attached to anything, with few ice holes on the way. Typical hardcore Russian style."According to Guinness World Records, the record for the longest swim under ice is held by Dane Stig Severinsen, who swam 250 feet in Greenland in 2013.The record for the longest female swim under ice is 229.659 feet and was achieved by South African Amber Fillary in Oppsjø, Norway, on February 29, 2020.
897,,Paris (CNN)A court in Paris will hear a landmark case accusing the French government of taking inadequate action to combat climate change.The case is part of a lawsuit launched two years ago and the hearing will start Thursday, a judicial source confirmed to CNN."Great day for #climate justice," tweeted Greenpeace France, one of the plaintiffs in the case.The lawsuit was launched by four NGOs, including Greenpeace France and Oxfam France, following an online petition that gathered 2.3 million signatures -- the largest in French history, according to the organizers.Climate activists took to the streets near the Paris administrative tribunal Thursday morning. Images provided by the NGOs showed a giant banner which read: "We are 2.3 million."Read MoreThe signatories hope the court will "compel the State to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions" to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target set by the Paris Agreement, says the online petition.Activists brought a landmark case accusing the French state of inaction on climate change.The Paris Agreement, a pact signed into effect in 2016 by almost all the world's countries, seeks to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).Currently, the world is set to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.86 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) -- a non-profit analysis group which tracks government climate action. This will bring more extreme storms, heatwaves, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes.French campaigners also want recognition of "the State's climate inaction, that is to say the non-compliance by France of its commitments."Joe Biden's climate plan could put Paris Agreement targets 'within striking distance,' experts say  "Greenhouse gas emissions under this government's five-year term dropped at a pace that was twice as slow as the trajectories foreseen under the law," the NGOs said in a joint statement.In a legal memo seen by the NGOs and Le Monde newspaper in June last year, the French Environment Ministry denied that it failed to comply with its legal obligations to fight climate change and asked for the case to be dismissed.One of the arguments invoked by the government is that it cannot be held "solely responsible" for climate change in France, according to quotes of the memo published by Le Monde."France makes up around 1% of the world's population and emits around 1% of the planet's greenhouse gases each year," it said. "A substantial part of this pollution comes from industrial and agricultural activities," but also from "individual choices and decisions which it is not always possible to influence," the memo continued.Climate change lawsuits spreading around the world, says reportCNN  has contacted the Environment Ministry for comment.A verdict in the case is expected within 15 days, the NGOs said in their statement.Legal action on climate change has become a global phenomenon, according to a report published July 2019. By that date, lawsuits had been launched against governments and corporate interests in 28 countries, according to a report from the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics and Political Science.Researchers found that, while the US was the global leader in terms of climate change litigation, the prevalence of such lawsuits had spread worldwide.Sandrine Amiel and Gaëlle Fournier reported from Paris, France.

898,,(CNN)Tennis player Tennys Sandgren has boarded a plane to the Australian Open in Melbourne despite saying he tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. The American, a quarterfinalist at last year's tournament, had been ill and tested positive for the virus in November but returned another positive test earlier this week while feeling "totally healthy."In a series of posts on Twitter, Sandgren initially conceded that he may not be able to fly to the first tennis grand slam of the year but later wrote: "Wow I'm on the plane. Maybe I just held my breath too long. Craig Tiley [Tennis Australia CEO] is a wizard." In a post retweeted by Tiley, the Australian Open said Sandgren had been cleared to fly by the relative health authorities. "In the case of Tennys Sandgren, who has self-disclosed that he previously tested positive in late November, his medical file had to be reviewed by Victorian health authorities. Upon completion of that review he was cleared to fly," read the statement. Read MoreLisa Neville, Australia's Minister for Police and Emergency Services, confirmed on Twitter that Sandgren's positive result had been reviewed by health experts and "determined to be viral shedding from a previous infection, so was given the all clear to fly.""No one who is Covid positive for the first time -- or could still be infectious -- will be allowed in for the Aus Open," she wrote. It comes as three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray has tested positive for Covid-19, just days before he was due to fly to Melbourne.Murray is currently isolating at his home in Surrey, England, and it's unsure whether he'll be granted permission to compete in next month's event. In a tweet, organizers said Murray would now be unable to join the official charter flights to Australia and go through the mandatory quarantine period with the other players, suggesting he will not take part in the tournament.

'Totally recovered'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals who test positive but don't have any symptoms can stop isolating 10 days after the first positive test -- as long as they have not subsequently developed symptoms. But 10 days is just a general guideline, with viral shedding able to continue for longer. Following criticism on Twitter, the world No. 50 said: "There's not a single documented case where I would be contagious at this point. Totally recovered!"Over 1,000 players and coaches have started arriving for this year's event, which has already been delayed by three weeks. The tournament is set to run from February 8-21.

Tournament organizers said players would also "undergo a more rigorous testing schedule than most returning travelers." CNN's Christina Macfarlane and Aleks Klosok contributed to this report.
899,,London (CNN)A large proportion of doctors and nurses have been traumatized by working in intensive care during the coronavirus pandemic in the UK, a new study reveals, with almost half reporting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or depression, and some feeling they would be better off dead.The news came as UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said authorities are considering putting recovering Covid-19 patients into hotels as a "backup plan," such is the intense pressure being placed on hospitals by the latest surge in infections.The UK marked its second deadliest day since the start of the pandemic on Tuesday, with 1,243 new coronavirus-related deaths. It also reported 45,533 new cases, bringing the total case number to 3,117,882.England entered its third national lockdown last week as it battles to cope with the spread of a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus. The UK government and senior health officials have warned that many hospitals are on the verge of being overwhelmed.Ontario, Canada, implements stay-at-home order as officials warn of a looming health care system 'collapse'At a news conference Monday, Hancock said the variant was "putting the NHS [National Health Service] under very significant pressure," with Covid-related hospital admissions up 22% on just the previous week.Read MoreThe study -- which has not yet been peer reviewed -- was published Wednesday by researchers at King's College London. It analyzed the responses to an anonymous online survey in June and July of more than 700 doctors and nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs) across six different hospitals.Although nearly 60% of respondents reported good well-being, the study found that almost half of ICU staff reported symptoms consistent with a probable diagnosis of PTSD, severe depression or anxiety, or problem drinking. Almost one in seven (13.4%) of ICU staff reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past two weeks.Today's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction podcast also deals with the mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers. Listen here.Around 45% of respondents met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of these measures: severe depression (6.3%), PTSD (39.5%), severe anxiety (11.3%) or problem drinking (7.2%).Nursing staff were more likely to report higher levels of distress than doctors or other clinical staff, the researchers found. Almost half of those who completed the surveys were nurses and just over 40% were doctors. The researchers found that doctors consistently reported better health than nurses.The study, led by Neil Greenberg of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, was published online in the journal Occupational Medicine."Our results highlight the potential profound impact that Covid-19 has had on the mental health of frontline UK staff," the study says."(The) probable PTSD rate we report was around nine times that found within the general population and more than double that found in recent combat veterans."Greenberg tweeted that the study "shows clearly that many ICU staff are understandably having a very tough time." He urged them not to feel stigmatized and to seek free help if needed through the NHS.The researchers note that ICU staff have experienced many stressors during the pandemic, including staff shortages, fears of contracting the virus and endangering their loved ones, concerns over a lack of personal protective equipment, and distress relating to the loss of patient lives despite their best efforts.Staff 'burnt out and exhausted'Psychotherapist and author Owen O'Kane, who previously worked as an NHS clinical lead for mental health and as a palliative care nurse, said he was not surprised by the study's findings although they were "quite shocking" to read.'Unacceptable' food parcels criticized by Marcus Rashford investigated by UK government"It's been a relentless year so it didn't surprise me that staff are struggling," he told CNN. "They are used to dealing with stressful environments and they are used to dealing with death and tough decisions -- but I think part of the challenge at the moment is that it is relentless. There is no real letup, they seem to be constantly having to deal with difficult situations, they are constantly watching lots of people die," he said. "You've clearly got a lot of staff burnt out and exhausted just purely because of what they are up against every day."O'Kane, author of "Ten to Zen," noted that the survey was done last summer, adding: "If they interviewed people now, they would probably find that those statistics would be worse than the ones that we've seen." He also observed that it was unusual for PTSD to develop as soon as in those surveyed. "Because people are being continually exposed to trauma, you are seeing PTSD symptoms coming earlier," he said. "When this is finished and we get some degree of normality back in their lives... I do think we will see a significantly higher amount of PTSD symptoms emerging." O'Kane said it was important for health care workers to look after themselves, using simple methods like meditation, going for walks and talking with colleagues, friends or family.And he urged anyone suffering PTSD symptoms to not hang back from seeking professional help. "The quicker you get help, the sooner you'll recover and the more you'll function," he said.Hotel plan for patientsThe study's findings will only increase concern over the stress being placed on NHS staff in England as they struggle to treat record numbers of patients with Covid-19.Hancock said Wednesday that putting Covid patients into hotels was being considered as a "backup plan" by the country's authorities but that it was "obviously not what I want to do.""We are considering all the options, it isn't something that we're actively putting in place. But I would say that it would only ever happen if that was clinically right for any individual patient," Hancock told the BBC.Ireland has the world's highest Covid-19 rate. How did it go so wrong?"There is a lag from the number of cases, through to the number of people turning up in hospital. So we know that those pressures on the NHS are going to continue to build over the next couple of weeks," he added.Hancock said the temporary Nightingale hospitals set up by NHS England amid the first wave of the pandemic were there as a fallback for hospitals.Asked about what kind of patients would be sent to hotels, the Health Secretary said it "would be for step-down patients or patients who have been in hospital, who no longer need the full hospital treatment but aren't quite ready to go home."London and southeast England are among the areas worst affected by the new variant, although it has now spread across the UK and has been detected in at least 50 more countries, including badly-hit Ireland. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Wednesday that tougher restrictions would be imposed there from Saturday to try to control the spread of the variant, which accounts for 60% of new cases in the country.Sturgeon said the stricter measures, including a ban on people entering restaurants or cafes to collect takeout, would crucially "stop people from meeting and interacting indoors and outdoors."London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday declared a "major incident" in the English capital "due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus ... and the increase of Covid-19 cases in hospitals, which has left the NHS at risk of being overwhelmed."The UK government is pinning its hopes of bringing the crisis under control on a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive."So far across the UK, we've given 2.6 million doses to 2.3 million people, and we've protected more people through vaccinations than all the countries in Europe put together," Hancock said at a Downing Street press briefing Monday.Hancock said the UK was on track to deliver a first dose of the vaccine to "everyone in the top four cohorts" -- which account for 88% of Covid-19 related deaths -- by February 15. Those groups encompass all elderly care home residents and staff, all those aged 70 and over and frontline health and social care workers.Two-fifths of over-80s and almost a quarter of older care home residents had received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Monday, Hancock said.CNN's Martin Goillandeau, Duarte Mendonca  and Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.

901,,Lamezia Terme, Italy,One of Italy's largest-ever mafia trials kicked off on Wednesday, with more than 320 suspected mobsters and their associates facing an array of charges, including extortion, drug trafficking and theft.The case targets the 'Ndrangheta clan, which is based in Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot, and is considered by prosecutors to be the most powerful mafia group in the country, easily eclipsing the more famous Cosa Nostra gang in Sicily.The trial is being held in a converted call-center in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme, with defendants placed in metal cages and rows of desks set up for the hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors, journalists and spectators expected to attend.Many of the accused are white-collar workers, including lawyers, accountants, businesspeople, local politicians and police officers, who chief prosecutor Nicola Gratteri says willingly aided the 'Ndrangheta in building its crime empire.The special courtroom is pictured on January 13, 2021 prior to the opening of the trial in Lamezia Terme, Italy.Speaking to reporters as he entered the courthouse, Gratteri said the investigation had encouraged locals to speak out.Read More"In the last two years we have seen a surge in lawsuits from oppressed entrepreneurs and citizens, victims of usury, people who for years have lived under the threats of the 'Ndrangheta," said the prosecutor, who has spent more than 30 years fighting the mob.The state will call on 913 witnesses and draw on 24,000 hours of intercepted conversations to support the myriad charges.The Mafia is poised to exploit coronavirus, and not just in ItalyGratteri said he expected the trial would take a year to complete, with the court due to sit six days a week.Another 92 suspects have opted for a fast-track trial in the same case, with their hearings due to start later in January, while a much smaller group of defendants will stand trial in February over five murders -- including the killing of a mafia hitman who was shot dead because he was gay, prosecutors say.The last time Italy tried hundreds of alleged mafiosi simultaneously was in 1986 in Palermo in a case which represented a turning point in the fight against Cosa Nostra, marking the beginning of the group's sharp decline.That trial had a huge impact because it targeted numerous mob families. The Calabrian trial focuses primarily on just one group -- the Mancuso clan from the province of Vibo Valentia -- leaving much of the 'Ndrangheta's top hierarchy untouched."The road ahead is still very long, but we mustn't give up because there are thousands of people who believe in us. We can't let them down," Gratteri told Reuters.

903,,(CNN)The UK government is investigating food parcels sent to low-income families to feed vulnerable children after campaigners -- including England international footballer Marcus Rashford -- criticized the provisions as "unacceptable."Families eligible for free school meals (FSM) have been sent food packages while schools in England are shut to most pupils as part of the country's third national lockdown. But recipients have been posting images online complaining about the provisions.One post from a Twitter user called Roadside Mum on Monday, shared more than 27,000 times, detailed the items she was sent by Chartwells, one of the companies contracted by the UK government.Roadside Mum said the parcel contained ingredients to make two jacket potatoes with beans and eight single cheese sandwiches, plus some snacks, pasta and a single tomato.Read More#FreeSchoolMeals bag for 10 days:2 days jacket potato with beans8 single cheese sandwiches2 days carrots3 days apples2 days soreen3 days frubesSpare pasta & tomato.

"The private company who have the #FSM contract made good profit here," the post added.Supplier Chartwells responded on Twitter, saying: "This does not reflect the specification of one of our hampers." The company asked for further details so it could "investigate immediately."CNN has contacted Chartwells for further comment.

He was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his campaign.On Tuesday Rashford posted a Twitter thread following a conversation with Chartwells that morning. He said there had been little communication with suppliers before England's lockdown was announced by the government."Children shouldn't be going hungry on the basis that we aren't communicating or being transparent with plans," said Rashford. "That is unacceptable."British lawmaker Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour party, also waded in.UN report compares UK welfare policies to Victorian workhouses"The images appearing online of woefully inadequate free school meal parcels are a disgrace," tweeted Starmer on Tuesday.

905,,(CNN)Call it showmanship, call it extraordinary spatial awareness, but LeBron James took his performance to a whole new level against the Houston Rockets on Tuesday.Already ahead by 21 points against the Rockets in the second quarter, James caught a pass in the corner in front of his Los Angeles Lakers bench, and heard Dennis Schroder's voice in his ear. "I told him to bet a Benjamin on it, so he shot it," Schroder said.James then swivelled to meet Schroder's eyes as he attempted the three-pointer,"I took the bet while I was still shooting the ball," explained the four-time NBA champion."A bet isn't official until you look a man in the eye, so I had to look him into the eye, and I was able to win that one."Read MoreTo the delight of his teammates and with James still not facing the basket, the shot went in, causing the Lakers bench to erupt in celebration.

"I literally have done everything that I can. This situation is crazy. It's something that I don't think can be fixed."Despite the additions of veterans such as John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, the normally free-flowing offense of the Rockets has looked discombobulated this year.And this is epitomized by Harden's own struggles. The 31-year-old has won the NBA's scoring champion title for the past three seasons, but has failed to score more than 20 points in four straight games, his longest such run since 2012."We're not even close, honestly, to that team -- obviously the defending champions -- and to all the other elite teams out there," Harden said. "You can tell the difference in these last two games."Obviously, chemistry, talent-wise, everything, and it was clear like I said these last few games.

906,,(CNN)Thousands of babies and children died in 18 of Ireland's mother and baby homes -- church-run institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret, often against their will -- over eight decades, according to a landmark report.On Tuesday, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters -- which was set up to investigate what happened in 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes from 1922 to 1998 -- announced the 9,000 deaths as part of the final findings of its near six-year inquiry.Around 56,000 people -- from girls as young as 12, to women in their 40s -- were sent to the 18 institutions investigated, where some 57,000 children were born, according to the report.One in seven of those children (15%) didn't survive long enough to leave the homes, yet no alarm was raised by the State over the high mortality rates, even though it was "known to local and national authorities" and was "recorded in official publications," the report found. Prior to 1960, mother and baby homes "did not save the lives of 'illegitimate' children; in fact, they appear to have significantly reduced their prospects of survival," it said. Read MoreThe report called the infant mortality rates the most "disquieting feature of these institutions."Ireland's mother and baby home survivors have spent decades fighting for the truth. They can finally see an end in sight  Speaking on Tuesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that the report "opens a window onto a deeply misogynistic culture in Ireland over several decades," and that the report "reveals significant failures of the state and of society."Martin formally apologized to the survivors of the homes on Wednesday, for the "profound generational wrong" visited upon them. Speaking in the Irish parliament, he said the report was a "moment for us as a society, to recognize a profound failure of empathy, understanding and basic humanity, over a very lengthy period.""I want to emphasize that each of you were in an institution because of the wrongs of others, each of you is blameless," Martin said, addressing the survivors.The report, which runs to more than 2,800 pages, was released just days after its key findings were leaked to a national newspaper -- compounding the pain and anguish of survivors who have waited years for the final report -- and who had been promised a first view of it by the Minister of Children. In his apology, Martin also discussed the role of conservative religion in the scandal. The Catholic Church and institutions associated with it are highly influential in Ireland.The Taoiseach said the most striking thing revealed in the report was the "shame felt by women who became pregnant, outside of marriage" in the country."We embraced the perverse religious morality and control, judgementalism and moral certainty but shunned our daughters," Martin said.He added that Irish society at the time had a "completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy" for which "young mothers and their sons and daughters" were "forced to pay the price."Martin also said that the conservative Catholic values of the time did "not diminish the responsibility of churches and state for the failures laid bare." "The state's duty of care was not upheld," he said, addressing survivors. "The state failed you, mothers, and children in these homes."Susan Lohan, co-founder of the Adoption Rights Alliance and a member of a dedicated survivors group appointed to advise the government, told CNN on Tuesday that the ​leaked extracts of the report, ​seen on Sunday, show that the Irish government may seek to "trivialize" the human rights abuses that took place on a "massive scale" inside of these homes. Survivor Philomena Lee, who spent years searching for the son she was forced to give up for adoption said in a statement on Sunday that she had "waited decades for this moment -- the moment when Ireland reveals how tens of thousands of unmarried mothers, such as I, and the tens of thousands of our beloved children, such as my dear son Anthony, were torn asunder, simply because we were unwed at the moment our children were born."Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, Tipperary, which operated as a mother and baby home from 1930 to 1970.During her time at the Sean Ross Abbey mother and baby home, Lee said that she was "deprived" of her liberty, independence and autonomy, and was "subject to the tyranny of the nuns," who told mothers daily that they were to atone for their sins by "working for our keep and surrendering our children to the nuns for forced adoption."Lee, whose story was told in an Oscar-nominated movie starring Judi Dench, added that she was "taunted" by the nuns during a difficult labor, who she says told her that the "pain was a punishment for my promiscuity."The commission's final report reported that this practice was not unusual. For many survivors and advocate groups, there is concern that the report fails to vindicate their experience.Lohan told national broadcaster RTE that the institutions were a "form of social engineering," and that the "state and church worked in concert to ensure that women -- unmarried mothers and girls who were deemed to be a threat to the moral tone of the country" were "incarcerated behind these very high walls to ensure that they would not impact or offend public morality."On Tuesday, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs Roderic O'Gorman said: "The report makes clear that for decades, Ireland had a stifling, oppressive and brutally misogynistic culture, where a pervasive stigmatization of unmarried mothers and their children robbed those individuals of their agency and sometimes their future."For many people, Martin's official apology is not enough.Lohan ​told CNN on Tuesday that she disagrees with a state apology, saying that ​no apology should be issued until survivors have had a chance to read and digest the Commission's findings, which could take many weeks.  A memorial at the former site of the Tuam Home in County Galway, where the bodies of hundreds of babies who died there were put into   a decommissioned sewage tank.
She also suggested that an apology should be the first of a series of several, noting that the commission's investigations only covered 18 institutions, while some 180 sites were part of a system that facilitated ​child neglect, premature death, forced adoptions, enforced disappearances, enforced labor, the stripping of identities, the falsification of state documents and the forging of mothers' ​consents. The report does not ​appear to fully address the allegations of forced or illegal adoptions, only stating that "many allegations have been made that large sums of money were given to the institutions and agencies in Ireland that arranged foreign adoptions. Such allegations are impossible to prove and impossible to disprove."Lee also underlined the role that other state-run and private institutions played, saying in her statement that she "can only hope" that the authors of the report recognize that "those of us who were detained against our will ... and who gave birth there, are not all of the mothers nor all of the children who have suffered."Tens of thousands went through other state-run hospitals and private institutions and "suffered the same fate," she said.Having since had a brief glimpse of the report's summary on Tuesday, Lohan said that survivors were left feeling underwhelmed by the apparent lack of attention to the major topics and that some survivors felt their evidence had been disbelieved as the Commission had dismissed certain allegations, citing lack of evidence.  The question as to why the homes were established in the first place appears to have been glossed over, some advocate groups said, undercutting the trauma endured by mothers and their children.While the report documented the testimony of women who detailed torture and beatings, it said that "there is no doubt that women in mother and baby homes were subjected to emotional abuse but there is very little evidence of physical abuse and no evidence of sexual abuse."Mary Harney, who was born in the Bessborough home and was later sent to an industrial school in Cork, said a first read of its findings had left her feeling that the report was "for the most part, in favor of the perpetrators."For decades, Ireland's mother and baby homes were shrouded in secrecy. Some say the veil still hasn't lifted"They say that the conditions in the homes were bad -- and they pick out various homes -- but they say overall there was no evidence of systematic abuse," Harney said. She points out that consistent issues at Bessborough were known to health authorities -- the report itself says "successive inspections" of the home "revealed major shortcomings.""What would it take (for them) to classify something as gross abuse?" she asked. The report also does not appear to address the testimony of some survivors who have said that senior members of the Catholic Church forced them to enter the homes, in addition to their family members."There is no evidence that women were forced to enter mother and baby homes by the church or State authorities. Most women had no alternative," it said, also stating that "it must be acknowledged that the institutions under investigation provided a refuge -a harsh refuge in some cases -when the families provided no refuge at all."In a statement released by Archbishop Eamon Martin on Tuesday evening, he said: "I accept that the Church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatized, judged and rejected." He apologized to survivors and those impacted for the "long-lasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted."Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Micheál Martin said that "in principle I think the religious orders concerned should make a contribution" to a proposed redress scheme.On Wednesday he also acknowledged that an official apology "on its own is not enough," adding that the Irish government "will be judged by our actions." 'Destroyed' recordsIn addition to the report's public release on Tuesday, O'Gorman also brought forward legislation to advance the "burials legislation" to "support the excavation, exhumation and, where possible, identification of remains, and their dignified reburial" at the site in Tuam, County Galway, which was first identified by local historian Catherine Corless, whose tireless work in 2014 was the catalyst for the commission's launch.  The legislation will also apply to "any other site where intervention is reasonably required," according to the Ministry of Children and Youth Affairs.Some 973 children died at, or near, the Tuam mother and baby home, according to the commission, which revealed that some of their remains had been found inside a decommissioned sewage tank.Only 50 records of burials at Tuam have been located; others "may have been lost or destroyed over the years," according to a March 2019 interim report.The names of some of the 796 children who died at the Tuam home are seen at a memorial in County Galway in 2019. 
Other interim reports, of which there are seven, have detailed further details of the horrific circumstances that mothers and their children faced inside these institutions. A total of 900 babies born at or admitted to hospitals near County Cork's Bessborough home died in infancy or early childhood.In 1944, infant mortality rates at the Bessborough home peaked at 82%. Only 64 of those 900 babies' graves have ever been located. The report said that at the Bethany home, which was founded by a Protestant evangelical group, 62% of children born in 1943 died within the first year of their lives. The commission also found that between 1920 and 1977, the bodies of more than 950 children who had died in some of the homes were sent to university medical schools for "anatomical studies."  Restricted accessWhile the release of the final report closes a chapter on the commission's work, survivors' rights groups say their work is not over.Survivors have long hoped that the commission would reveal more about allegations of arbitrary detention, cruelty and neglect, forced adoption and vaccine trials that went on inside the homes, as well as hold wrongdoers to account.And crucially, they also hoped it would help them to access their personal records, including information about missing relatives and babies buried in unmarked graves.In October, the government passed a law promising to seal the commission's archive from survivors and the public for 30 years. Days later, the government changed its position, saying survivors of the homes were legally entitled to access their personal data.Critics of the law had successfully argued that sealing the commission's records was illegal under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU directive which gives individuals the right to access their data. An Irish daughter seeks to end shame of her secret adoptionNow, survivors' rights groups are warning that the government -- and state agencies including the child and family agency, Tusla -- are still restricting survivors' access to their own records.In a statement to CNN, Tusla put the issue of access back on the government, saying that "the absence of legislation to deal with the provision of information will continue to be a source of great anxiety for people, and the resolution of this issue is beyond the reach of Tusla.""We recognize the hurt and trauma experienced by those who are affected by the Commission's report into Mother and Baby Homes, that are understandably searching their identity," the statement said.Martin confirmed Wednesday that the Irish government "is committed to introducing information and facing legislation as a priority" which will facilitate access to records."To confront the dark and shameful reality, which is detailed in this report we must acknowledge it as a part of our national history," he said Wednesday.In the meantime, the agency is still routinely denying survivors -- particularly adopted people -- access to their own personal information, their birth certificates, their identities, and even their ethnicities, Lohan says."These abuses, they didn't end in 1998 when the last of the dreadful places closed."

907,,(CNN)Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says his team will do its best to keep within the new Covid-19 guidelines as the Premier League looks to clampdown on celebrations.In a document reportedly sent out to teams on Tuesday, made public on social media, organizers underlined that behaviors during training and matches must change, whilst strengthening some of the protocols in place.The league reminded teams that "unnecessary contact, particularly between opposition clubs including handshakes, high fives and hugs must be avoided" and that swapping of shirts after the game is now prohibited.Speaking after his side's 1-0 win over Burnley on Tuesday, a result which sees United sit top of the table, Solskjaer said it's hard to keep emotions under control when passions are running high.Here's the infographic & FAQ's on toughened Covid protocols the Premier League has distributed to clubs for players & coaches.Reminds them "unnecessary contact, including hugging, must be avoided"The new rules are to be "reinforced" by match officials in pre-match briefings pic.twitter.com/3pmOBNrecj— Dan Roan (@danroan) January 13, 2021 United players celebrated by hugging each other on Tuesday after Paul Pogba scored the only goal of the game.Read More"It's an emotional game but we have to understand the players when they celebrate but we also understand the concern nowadays for a bit less emotion and less hugging," Solskjaer told reporters."But it's difficult because football brings out the best and the worst in you. Of course when you score you want to celebrate with your teammates."We will do our best to keep with the guidelines of course we will because we I think we all want football to carry on safely. I think mentally for many people it's a relief but we understand the situation that the country is in."Whilst lockdown restrictions have been imposed across the UK amid record high confirmed cases, elite sport has been allowed to continue, though organizers have urged clubs to abide by a strict set of rules.And match officials and compliance officers will check that clubs are following the updated guidance amid a number of breaches in recent weeks.Players from Tottenham and Manchester City, amongst others, were caught breaking rules over the festive period.On Monday, the league announced 36 players and club staff had tested positive in the latest round of testing. It comes as the UK passed the grim tally of 80,000 deaths as a result of Covid-19.Minister for Sport, Tourism and Heritage Nigel Huddleston urged teams to diligently abide by the rules."Everyone in the country has had to change the way they interact with people and ways of working. Footballers are no exception," he wrote on Twitter."Covid secure guidelines exist for football. Footballers must follow them and football authorities enforce them -- strictly."According to the BBC, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters wrote a letter to clubs saying he was concerned to see players ignore social distancing measures over the weekend."This brings justified additional scrutiny and the league must take the lead in setting the right example," he said.CNN has reached out to the Premier League but is yet to receive a response.Five EPL matches have already been postponed due to Covid-19 outbreaks this season and Aston Villa's tie with Everton on Saturday is the latest to be under threat with multiple Villa players and staff self-isolating.READ: Premier League stars condemned for Covid lockdown breachManchester United players celebrate after Paul Pogba scores. Surprise leaders across EuropeSolskjaer's side now sit three points clear of second-placed Liverpool ahead of its trip to Anfield on Sunday, in what could be a pivotal moment in the title race.It's the first time Manchester United has been top of the table at the turn of the year since it won the league in 2013."We have to keep calm, now it is the big moment. We will see what is going to happen," Pogba said after Tuesday's match.Elsewhere in Europe, Atletico Madrid underlined its title credentials in Spain after beating Sevilla 2-0 on Tuesday.Goals from Angel Correa and Saul Niguez were enough to earn all three points against an inform Sevilla side.The result means Atletico is now four points clear of second-placed Real Madrid having played two games less.Atleti last won La Liga in 2014, also the last time the title hasn't gone to either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
908,,Moscow  (CNN)Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny has announced that he plans to return to Russia on Sunday from Germany, where he has been recovering after being poisoned. On Instagram, Navalny said that he purchased a plane ticket to Russia on Wednesday morning after realizing that "he is almost healthy and can finally come back home.""There was never a question for me whether to return or not, never. Just because I didn't leave. I ended up in Germany, having arrived there in an intensive care box. On January 17, Sunday, I will return home on Pobeda airline flight. Meet me," Navalny tweeted on Wednesday.On Monday, Russian prison authorities sent an official request to a court asking to replace his suspended sentence in a years-old case with a real jail term. Navalny was poisoned with the toxin Novichok in August and nearly died. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement.Read MoreHe is currently in Germany, after receiving treatment at Berlin's Charite clinic.Russian authorities launch new criminal investigation against opposition leader Alexey Navalny Recent reporting from investigative group Bellingcat and CNN revealed that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) had formed an elite team specializing in nerve agents that trailed Navalny for years. Phone and travel records suggest that the unit followed Navalny to at least 17 cities since 2017.The investigation pieced together how the elite unit followed Navalny's team throughout its August trip to Siberia.Another CNN-Bellingcat report featured a phone call in which Navalny duped one of the agents into revealing that he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok applied to his underwear. In a video address posted on his Instagram account Wednesday, the activist said new criminal cases brought against him in Russia were "demonstratively fabricated" and an attempt to prevent him coming back to his home country.The Russian Federal Penitentiary Service said that by staying in Germany Navalny was violating the terms of his suspended sentence in the so-called Yves Rocher case, which Navalny believes is politically motivated.In 2014, Navalny was found guilty of fraud after he and his brother Oleg were accused of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Alexey Navalny was given a suspended sentence and his brother was sentenced to a prison term.Russia launched a new fraud accusation and jail threat against Navalny at the end of 2020, increasing pressure on him.The country's Investigative Committee has also accused Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation of "fraud on a large scale" for allegedly misusing donations from supporters and spending them on "private purposes."Navalny dismissed the charges against him. "I've survived. And now Putin, who gave the order to murder me, screeches all over his bunker and tells his servants to do everything so that I do not return. The servants act as per usual: they fabricate new criminal cases against me," Navalny said in Wednesday's Instagram video."They are doing everything to scare me. But what they are doing there is not of much interest to me. Russia is my country, Moscow is my city, I miss them," he added.Putin -- who refuses to acknowledge Navalny as a legitimate opponent -- has described extensive media investigation into the poisoning as a fabrication by Western intelligence, and said in December that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they "would have finished" the job.Russian police raid home of opposition activist Lyubov Sobol, Navalny saysThe Russian leader also claimed last month without evidence that Navalny is being supported by US intelligence services, adding, "if that's correct, then that's interesting, then of course [our] special services need to keep an eye on him."CNN's Mary Ilyushina reported from Moscow, Zamira Rahim wrote from London.
909,,Cork, Ireland (CNN)When Ireland came out of a strict six-week lockdown in December it had one of the lowest levels of Covid-19 cases in Europe. Since then, the situation has dramatically unraveled.The country recorded the highest infection rate in the world last week, according to Our World in Data, an online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford.In the seven days leading up to January 10, Ireland reported around 1,323 Covid-19 cases per one million people, the statistics showed, more than any other country over the same period. On Friday, it recorded the highest daily increase in infections since the beginning of the pandemic with 8,248 new cases, according to a statement from the Irish health department. "The alarming level of disease is unprecedented in terms of our experience of the levels of Covid-19 in the community," warned Professor Philip Nolan, a member of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). "We are seeing numbers of cases per day, and numbers in hospital, that we just could not have comprehended prior to Christmas."      Read MoreIreland's medical experts, politicians and members of the public are now all debating what went wrong.The seasonality of the virus, the presence of the more transmissible UK variant, and households mixing over the holidays all contributed to the surge, according to a spokesperson from Prime Minister Micheál Martin's office.The spike is not "simplistic" and there have been a number of factors that have led to it, the spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday."We had the rise in socializations over the Christmas period and our public health experts said the seasonality of the virus was a huge factor," they said.Ireland reopened hospitality and other sectors with some restrictions on December 4. Defending that decision, the spokesperson said the sectors involved "by and large" adhered to the public health measures and the incidence of infection was "relatively low" in hospitality, retail and construction settings. The more contagious UK variant, discovered in Ireland for the first time on Christmas Day, "had a very significant impact [on] the growth of cases because it is believed to be between 50% and 70% more transmissible," the spokesperson added.Covid death records shattered across Europe as London declares 'major incident'Some 40% of Ireland's most recent positive cases of Covid-19 are caused by the more contagious UK variant, said Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, in a statement on Monday.From December 18, Irish households were allowed to mix with up to two others, despite other European countries canceling Christmas gatherings.More than 54,000 people flew into the Republic of Ireland between December 21 and January 3, according to the Department of Justice."There was no properly managed isolation system in place," the president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, Gabriel Scally, told CNN over the phone on Tuesday. "Ireland and Britain are unsuccessful islands in Covid terms when you look at others. There was an understandable desire for normality over Christmas after a hard year; but the virus doesn't know that." Ireland shut restaurants, pubs serving food and some shops on Christmas Eve and has since further tightened its lockdown measures -- including closing non-essential construction sites, schools, and childcare services.People walk down Grafton Street in Dublin city center on January 6 after lockdown measures were reimposed.There are currently 1,582 Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Ireland, of which 146 are in intensive care, just short of the springtime peak of 155, according to the health department. "We know that hospitalisations occur some weeks after a confirmed case is notified, and mortality after that again," said Ireland's chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, in a statement on Monday. "That means we are unfortunately set for a period of time where the situation in our hospitals gets worse before it gets better."Ireland has only five intensive care beds per 100,000 people, much lower than the OECD22 average of 12, according to OECD data.So far the country has reported a total of more than 152,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,352 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.As for the recent spike, the tools to address "this accelerated growth rate" are in Ireland's hands, according to Nolan, who chairs NPHET's Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group.He added that he hoped the current measures would "significantly suppress transmission of the virus."

910,,(CNN)Baby sharks are being born smaller, undernourished and exhausted as climate change warms the world's oceans, researchers say.Researchers examined the effects of warming temperatures on the growth, development and physiology of the Great Barrier Reef's epaulette sharks, testing embryos and hatchlings in waters up to 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 degrees Fahrenheit).The research team found that in warmer waters, shark embryos grew faster and used their yolk sac -- their only source of food in this developmental stage -- quicker. The creatures hatched earlier, were born smaller, and needed to feed straight away, but lacked energy, researchers from Australia's ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University and the University of Massachusetts said Tuesday. There are more than 500 types of shark living around the world, and the majority give birth to live young. Some shark species, like epaulette sharks, lay eggs, which are left unprotected and must be able to survive on their own for up to four months. Oceans are warming at the same rate as if five Hiroshima bombs were dropped in every secondRead More"The epaulette shark is known for its resilience to change, even to ocean acidification," Jodie Rummer, co-author and associate professor at  the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said in a statement. "So, if this species can't cope with warming waters then how will other, less tolerant species fare?"The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef, covering nearly 133,000 square miles and is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species.The past decade has been the warmest on record for global ocean temperatures. By the end of the century, the Great Barrier Reef is likely to experience average summer temperatures close to or exceeding 31 degrees Celsius, researchers warn. Rummer said that rising ocean temperatures could threaten future sharks, including egg-laying and live-bearing species, because as temperatures rise, the creatures will be born or hatch into environments that they can barely tolerate."The study presents a worrying future given that sharks are already threatened," lead author Carolyn Wheeler said in a statement."Sharks are important predators that keep ocean ecosystems healthy. Without predators, whole ecosystems can collapse, which is why we need to keep studying and protecting these creatures,"  Wheeler, a PhD candidate at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, added.Landmark UN report warns sea levels will rise faster than projected by 2100"Our future ecosystems depend (on) us taking urgent action to limit climate change," Rummer said.The study was published in the Scientific Reports journal.Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change -- covering almost three quarters of Earth's surface, they absorb the vast majority of the world's heat. Although we often can't see it, ocean warming has a profound impact on the entire world. A warmer ocean causes sea level to rise, bringing problems like dangerous coastal flooding. It leads to the loss of sea ice, heating the waters even further, and can affect the jet stream, allowing cold Arctic air to reach farther south, making winters more intense and threatening animals that depend on sea ice. A warmer ocean also contributes to increases in rainfall and leads to stronger and longer-lasting storms like Hurricanes Florence and Harvey.Marine heatwaves which have killed off swathes of Earth's coral reefs have likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense, a landmark report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in 2019.CNN's Jen Christensen, Ivana Kottasová and Drew Kann contributed reporting.

912,,(CNN)Kazuyoshi Miura just can't give up playing football.The now-53-year-old striker signed a contract extension with Yokohama FC on Monday, meaning he will play into his 36th season as a professional. "I have renewed my contract with Yokohama FC for the 2021 season," Miura said in a statement. "Last season, the world was in a difficult situation because of the coronavirus pandemic, but thanks to many people, we are able to feel the joy of playing soccer.

Miura made his professional debut back in 1986 as a 19-year-old when he appeared for Brazilian side Santos -- before football superstar Lionel Messi was even born. After his time in Brazil elevated him into one of Japan's most famous sports stars, "King Kazu" returned to his homeland where he led Verdy Kawasaki to back-to-back titles in 1993 and 1994. He spent a loan spell with Serie A side Genoa in 1994, becoming the first Japanese player to play in the Italian first division. As well as stints in Croatia and Australia, Miura had a prolific international career with Japan. He won the Asian Cup in 1992, finishing with 55 goals in 89 games when he retired from international football in 2000 -- the second-most career goals in Japanese national team history. He signed for Yokohama FC in 2005, meaning this upcoming season will be his 17th at the club. Miura makes a run against Yokohama F Marinos.In 2017, he became the oldest player to score in a professional match when he scored against Thespakusatsu Gunma in Japan's second division at 50 years and 14 days.

913,,(CNN)A late equalizer saw Scottish champion Celtic draw 1-1 against Hibernian after one of its players tested positive for Covid-19 and 15 other members of playing and coaching staff were required to self-isolate. It meant Celtic was without manager Neil Lennon, assistant John Kennedy and 13 first-team players for Monday's game following defender Christopher Jullien's positive test days after the club returned from a winter training camp in Dubai. David Turnbull's well-hit free-kick looked to have secured victory for the depleted side, but Kevin Nisbet secured a draw for Hibernian with an injury-time strike. Celtic is now 21 points adrift of rival Rangers, albeit with three games in hand, and looks unlikely to win a 10th consecutive Scottish Premiership title."There's a sense of pride among the younger players but there's also a massive sense of frustration that we couldn't see it out," coach Gavin Strachan told Celtic TV.

The draw and Jullien's positive test came after criticism of the club's trip to Dubai earlier this month with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying during her coronavirus briefing on Monday that she was "disappointed and frustrated" with the situation. "As I have said before, I do have doubts, based on how the club itself described it, doubts about whether Celtic's trip to Dubai was really essential," Sturgeon said, adding that "everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution."Hibernian boss Jack Ross told Sky Sports that his players' families had expressed concerns ahead of the match against Celtic.

"These protocols have served us well in the past, as the club has not had one positive case in our own 'bubble' until now.

That's our stance on it."On Tuesday, Dubai was removed from the UK's travel exempt list, meaning those arriving from Dubai must self-isolate for 10 days."Since January 3, more than 50 people have tested positive for Covid in Scotland after returning from Dubai," Sturgeon said during her briefing."Now, let me be clear. That doesn't necessarily mean that they got Covid when they were in Dubai, but the volume of positive cases strongly suggests that there may well be significant risks attached to travel to and from Dubai right now."
914,,"Tiger" premiered on HBO, which like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia. (CNN)Tiger Woods always wanted us to believe that he was just like the rest of us. "We're all the same; we're all human," Woods told CNN Sport in 2006. And yet, in the same breath, he understood just how different he really was. Asked in the same interview where he could go in the world and not be recognized, he said: "Underwater!

Woods' agent didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the documentary.Nonetheless the producers were keen to hear his voice and perspective throughout, and there was no shortage of archived interview material to draw from.In one clip, Woods dismissed his father's expectations, saying: "That's just my Dad speaking, a proud father."But Earl was preaching to the world that his son would be little short of the second coming and, once he turned professional, his sponsors were only too happy to continue the sermon.As Hamachek observed: "It seemed like his entire life people were putting expectations and projecting what they wanted him to be onto Tiger."The film presents a narrative that Earl and Kultida -- the 15-time major winner's Mom -- raised an automaton capable of handling intense pressure on the golf course, with a ruthless drive for success.But it seems that they also created an environment which stunted his emotional growth, resulting in an imperfect human. At the height of his powers, Woods seemed to find comfort watching morning cartoons with a bowl of cereal.Woods puts on tthe Green Jacket with the help of Nick Faldo at the 1997 Masters presentation ceremony.READ: Michelle Wie West's retirement thoughts changed by having a baby girlSome of the most revealing testimony is provided by his first girlfriend Dina Parr, who says she could see where it was all heading."I felt like their plans were creating this robot. There was all this preparation for golf, but he had no life skills. He had not been prepared for life. And I was probably the only person around that really kept him in check."Parr says that their relationship ended abruptly when she received a cold and business-like termination letter from Woods, who "never wanted to see or hear" from her again. "I know this is sudden and a surprise, but it is in my opinion much warranted," wrote the golfer.Parr was devastated; she said they had been in love and were happy together: "It was like a death, the Tiger that I had known had died. His sweetness was stolen from him."Woods had learned golf from his father; he'd learned how to be tough from him, too. Famously, Earl was a green beret in the US military, operating behind enemy lines during two harrowing tours of duty in the horrific Vietnam War."My dad was always the person who would plant seeds and give me encouragement but also would say things that would fester inside me that wouldn't come to fruition for a while," Woods told USA Today in 2017."He was very worldly and deep in his thinking. My mom was the enforcer. My dad may have been in the Special Forces, but I was never afraid of him. My mom's still here, and I'm still deathly afraid of her. She's a very tough, tough old lady, very demanding. She was the hand, she was the one, I love her so much, but she was tough."Woods (C) appears in Palm Beach County court October 27, 2017 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He later pled guilty to a second-degree misdemeanor reckless driving charge.READ: After 'life-changing' major win, Collin Morikawa says fame won't change himSelf-destructive behaviorAt the age of 13, according to the documentary, Tiger had apparently been taught to hypnotize himself, to tune out extraneous noise.As Woods' own life subsequently spiraled out of control, the details of the story become a little more sordid.Some conservative viewers may find themselves clutching their pearls by the time he's cheating on his wife, Elin, with reckless abandon in a church parking lot. It was a pattern of self-destructive behavior that presented the film's directors with another challenge -- how much should be revealed?Hamachek and Heineman ​say they were reluctant to overly sensationalize the details, but nor could they underplay the relevance of them.They say they recognized that Woods' children might one day see the film, so every decision in the edit suite was handled with a great deal of care. "It wasn't going to be TMZ, and it also wasn't going to be a puff piece," said Hamachek.Heineman added: "This is really a psychological portrait of the man through these interviews, and there are details in the show that touch on things that I wouldn't necessarily want to have revealed about myself. But that is his story and we couldn't shy away from that."Through the insight of Woods' first love Parr and two family friends, Pete McDaniel and Grohman, the film claims to explain the making of the man.Woods walks off the first tee during the second round of the 2011 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on April 8, 2011 in Augusta, Georgia.READ: After making history, Danish golfer is a star on the riseBut it's through the original testimony of Rachel Uchitel, speaking on camera for the first time, that we see what that man became.Uchitel , who became a public figure as a result of her relationship with Tiger, sheds new light on a man who was seemingly trying to escape from the pressure of it all, and she found herself in the eye of the storm when their cover was blown.As a teenager, Parr's relationship with Woods was ended with a letter; Uchitel says her termination was crafted by a lawyer. His longtime caddie Steve Williams also discovered that friendship with Woods can be revoked at a moment's notice and there is no going back.And yet, there doesn't seem to be any resentment from those who ​say they were cast aside."I think one of the most interesting psychological things is how unbelievably protective they still are," says Heineman. "There wasn't anger; there wasn't bitterness. It was still so much love for this man, even though he might have hurt them deeply."Asked what they think the moral of Woods' story might be, the directors struggle to identify it; because he is such a complex character, he can't be "put in a box."High school student  Woods, 17, reacts after dropping a birdie putt on the 15th hole of the Los Angeles Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, Calif., on Thursday, Feb. 25, 1993.READ: When Seve 'swashbuckled' his way to magnificent Masters titleBut Hamachek ​believes that no one has been merely ​a spectator of his golf or will be ​a disinterested ​viewer of this film; ​everyone has been more involved than that."We sort of played a role in cheering him on when he was on the rise, and a lot of people in the public took a great deal of glee in his downfall. "And then we're right back there to cheer him on in the comeback. One of the things that I found fascinating about this story is how the public at large is sort of culpable in his story as well.""We all projected ourselves onto this man," says Heineman. "We wanted him to be this perfect poster boy for breaking through and breaking barriers and doing many things, and so when that didn't happen, our own expectations were broken and our own views of ourselves and our own visions were broken."I hope that in watching the show, you can at least feel like you're in his shoes, [feeling] what that pressure and what that spotlight really feels like."Woods practises on Griffith Park golf course as a 16-year old in 1991.READ: Is golf set for a new era of dominance after Johnson's record-breaking Masters win?Father and sonJust weeks before the film's release, Woods was back in the news. Or, more pertinently, his 11-year-old son Charlie was in the news -- playing golf in public for the first time.Charlie's greenside presence, when his Dad won the 2019 Masters to complete his most extraordinary comeback, represented the completion of the father-son arc. Charlie's emergence as a young, exceptional golfing talent in his own right marks a generational shift and the start of a new chapter.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos"It's quite interesting seeing Charlie and Tiger out there playing together," says Heineman. "What has he learned as a human being? What has he learned as a father? Because he was taught many lessons by Earl, some of which obviously benefited him greatly, and I think some of which obviously hurt him greatly."The 15-time major winner would appear to have learned something else from his father, how to protect the privacy of his children. Whilst Charlie wowed us all with his prodigious talent, he was not made available for interview. This young man can thank his father for that, but it's a lesson his Dad was made to learn the hard way.Dan Kamal contributed to this report.
915,,London (CNN)The United Kingdom is entering its most challenging weeks since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a top official said Monday, as hospitals face being overrun and morgues fill up. "We're now at the worst point of this epidemic for the UK. In the future we will have the vaccine, but the numbers at the moment are higher than they were in the previous peak — by some distance," England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the BBC, adding that he expects the next few weeks to be the "most dangerous time." The country, which has already suffered more deaths as a result of the disease than any European nation and recently became the fifth nation on earth to reach the grim milestone of three million cases, is on the verge of seeing its hospitals overwhelmed. Whitty told the BBC on Monday that there were currently more than 30,000 patients in hospital, compared to 18,000 during the first peak of the virus in the UK in April.  As the world begins its vaccination push, delayed rollouts draw criticism and concern"We're now at a situation where in the UK as a whole, around one in 50 people is infected, and in London it's around 1 in 30," Whitty said. "There is a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily, they will have Covid." Read MoreHis warning comes with the country barely a week into its third national lockdown. But fears are growing that Britons are increasingly giving up on complying with the rules, as case numbers continue to surge despite the extreme measures. Whitty stressed that minimizing contact with others will stop the situation from getting worse."Every single unnecessary contact any of us have is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead eventually to a vulnerable person," he told the BBC. "So, the absolute key is for all of us to think do we really need to have this contact?"A patient arrives by ambulance at the Royal London hospital on January 8, 2021 in London, England. Whitty's intervention comes as the number of daily deaths in the UK remain very high, a point grimly illustrated by the fact that in one county in southern England, bodies are being stored at a temporary facility as morgues there are at capacity.  The temporary facility in Surrey, south of London, can hold an extra 800 bodies, on top of the 600 that can be held in morgues.A spokesperson for the Surrey Local Resilience Forum told the UK's PA news agency: "To put some perspective on this, during the first wave, they had 700 bodies go through that (temporary) facility ... The first wave lasted approximately 12 weeks from mid-March to mid-May ... Since December 21, after just two and a half weeks, they have had 300 bodies go through it." Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine appears to work against mutation in new coronavirus strains, study findsThe UK has been ahead of the curve on approving Covid-19 vaccinations and on Monday the government is expected to outline how it will hit its target of vaccinating 13 million people by February 15. A large part of the program will be handled by vaccination centers around the country -- the first of which opens on Monday -- and an army of volunteers who have been trained to administer the vaccine.  And even the good news that two million people have been vaccinated has been soured by reported shortages of the vaccine in some hospitals. It is unclear why the shortages are happening; the government has faced criticism for how it plans to prioritize handing out the doses it does have.  If Whitty's worst fears become reality, then the National Health Service will be under enormous strain as it attempts to cope with unprecedented hospital admissions, deal with dead bodies, vaccinate the most vulnerable citizens while also carrying out the normal procedures.  The government will be hoping that Whitty's stark warnings force citizens into complying with the measures to stop the spread of the virus.

918,,(CNN)Tennis star Ana Konjuh kept alive hopes of competing at her first grand slam in more than two years after outlasting Anna-Lena Friedsam in Australian Open qualifying in Dubai. Konjuh, a former world No. 20, has endured 18 months away from the game and undergone four elbow surgeries over the course of her young career. But her 6-2 6-7 6-4 victory over fourth seed Friedsam saw her advance to the second round of qualifying on Sunday and boost her chances of playing in a first major tournament since Wimbledon in 2018. The 23-year-old Croatian, who was granted a wildcard for qualifying, was comfortably leading 6-1 5-2 before Germany's Friedsam launched a comeback and commanded a break lead in the deciding set. Konjuh, however, rallied in the final three games and is now potentially two games away from a place in the Australian Open main draw.Read MoreREAD: Roger Federer withdraws from 2021 Australian OpenKonjuh progressed to the second round of Australian Open qualifying in Dubai. "I've been through so much the last couple of years and been to the top level, I know what it feels like," Konjuh, who reached her career-high ranking of 20th in July 2017 but has since slipped to 476th in the world, told the Australian Open website. "To have to go through all of the steps again to get there, it's hard, it's frustrating. "Right now I just feel privileged to have a chance to compete and be healthy, and I think that I just really appreciate these things so much more right now."It's the first time ever that Australian Open qualifying has taken place overseas with the women's matches staged in Dubai, UAE, and the men's in Doha, Qatar.Qualifying concludes on Wednesday with the tournament itself getting underway on February 8 -- a start date that has been delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic. There were also victories for Sara Errani, a runner-up in the French Open in 2012, and Tsvetana Pironkova, who reached the US Open quarterfinals last year, on the first day of qualifying.
919,,(CNN)The Cleveland Browns know all about hard knocks. The team hadn't won a playoff game since 1995 before Sunday. Their head coach was in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19.So the weekend clash with division rivals Pittsburgh Steelers had all the earmarks of another painful evening for the long-suffering Browns fans.However, led by superstars Baker Mayfield and Myles Garrett -- and helped by regular Steelers errors -- the Browns raced into a 28-0 first quarter lead, eventually winning 48-37 in the first round of the NFL playoffs. Now it's the Browns' turn to dish out the hard knocks.It was the franchise's first postseason victory since 1994, and after a week where the team could only practice once because of Covid-19 protocols, acting head coach Mike Priefer praised the team's resilience."I told them after the game ...

In fact, Roethlisberger became the first quarterback ever to throw four touchdowns and four interceptions in a playoff game.Mayfield finished with 263 yards and three touchdowns in the first playoff game of his career as, despite the Steelers mounting a second-half comeback, the 25-year-old quarterback managed to steer the Browns to their historic win.As Browns players ran off the field in Pittsburgh, they mocked Juju Smith-Schuster's pre-game comments, with Mayfield yelling "The Browns going to be the Browns!" on his way to the locker-room.While Stefanski couldn't be there to celebrate in person, he -- and other missing players -- were involved in the celebrations virtually via Zoom."To have those guys there in our celebration was great," Mayfield said. "The best thing about it was the mentality of everybody saying: 'Hey, we did not just want to just win this game.'Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosEric Ebron of the Steelers is pursued by Garrett. "Like I said last week, it is just the stepping stone to where we eventually want to go.

923,,(CNN)All the signs are looking good that leading Italian football club AC Milan could secure its first Serie A title in 10 years.Milan defeated Torino 2-0 on Saturday to extend the Rossoneri's lead at the top of Serie A as second-place Internazionale drew at Roma on Sunday.After its 17 games -- nearly half the season -- Milan has 40 points, three ahead of city rivals Inter and 10 more than Juventus, though the defending champion has played two fewer matches than the Serie A leader ahead of its Sunday fixture against Sassuolo.But it's not just Milan's impressive league form -- its lost just one league game this season -- that is giving the club's fans confidence that this could be the year the team secures a 19th scudetto.Over the last 12 months, Milan has become the most improved team in Europe, according to a report from a leading sports data company, released earlier this month.Read More"AC Milan have improved more than any other team in Europe according to the Euro Club Index football ranking from Gracenote and Hypercube," said the Gracenote report.The Euro Club Index is based on results in competition over a four-year period, with an emphasis on recent results.Teams win or lose rating points from opponents every time a match is played. The number of points won or lost depends on how far apart the two clubs are. "AC Milan are the only team to have increased their Euro Club Index by over 500 points compared to this time last year," added the Gracenote report. "Over the last year, AC Milan have improved their Euro Club Index the most, by 531 points from 2732 to 3263."It added: "Milan's improvement means they have climbed from being the 47th best team in Europe a year ago to number 20 now."Zlatan Ibrahimovic passes the ball during the Serie A match between AC Milan and Torino.READ: 17-year-old lights up English football with goal -- and smileZlatan returnsFirst-half goals -- from Rafael Leaol and a Franck Kessie penalty -- secured Milan's win over Torino, with the Rossoneri further boosted by Zlatan Ibrahimovic's return from injury.Milan's talismanic 39-year-old, who has scored 10 league goals this season, came on as a second-half substitute in Saturday's victory.

925,,Rome (CNN)Pope Francis has said the Vatican will begin Covid-19 vaccinations next week and that he is in line to receive the shot.The pontiff made the comments during an interview with Italy's Canale 5 channel, set to air on Sunday night."It is an ethical duty to take the vaccine, here in the Vatican we will start next week, I am also in line to take it,"  he said, according to a news anchor for the channel in a preview of the interview, which was released Saturday.

But it is a reality, even in more mature realities there is always something wrong, something about people taking a path against the community, against democracy, against the common good."I thank God that this broke out and we could see it well, because this can be remedied, right?" Francis said in a preview clip seen by CNN, adding the violence "must be condemned."Vatican says vaccine is 'morally acceptable'In December, the Vatican deemed that it was morally acceptable to be vaccinated against Covid-19, after some anti-abortion groups raised concerns about how the vaccines were manufactured.Some groups had suggested the coronavirus vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses."It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process," the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Francis.The statement was issued and signed by the head of the Congregation in response to several requests for guidelines regarding the use of the vaccine.The pontiff used his recent Christmas message to say that coronavirus vaccines must be available for all, and pleaded with states to cooperate in the race to emerge from the pandemic.
926,,(CNN)Footballers don't usually smile after losing a game 4-1, but all is forgiven in the case of teenager Louie Barry.The 17-year-old was part of a youthful Aston Villa team -- with an average age of 18 years -- that was beaten by Liverpool in the English FA Cup third round on Friday. The FA Cup, which was founded in 1871, is the oldest domestic association cup competition.Against a strong Liverpool team that included the likes Mo Salah and Sadio Mane, Villa was forced to field a team of youngsters after the club suffered a Covid-19 outbreak earlier the week. The 11 players that started the game for Villa were all making their first-team debuts."Our experience of this situation in the past two days has been a frightening scenario because we went from 100% negative on 1 January to 14 cases," Villa chief executive officer Christian Purslow told BT Sport."Many of the players tonight are so young their mums and dads will be dropping them off at Villa Park."Louie Barry scores for Aston Villa in the team's FA Cup game against Liverpool.Read MoreLiverpool took an early lead through Mane's header but a wonderful solo goal by Barry ensured Villa were level at halftime.Midfielder Thiago Alcantara came on for Liverpool at the start of the second half and his introduction swung the game in the visitors' favor, with goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Salah as well as another Mane header ensuring victory for Jurgen Klopp's team.But it was Barry's goal and his post-match interviews, where he understandably just couldn't stop smiling, that encapsulated the vim and vigor of the Villa performance."I feel the team deserved it as well for how we applied ourselves to the half, and even the second half," a beaming Barry, who joined the Birmingham-based team from Barcelona last year, told Villa TV."When I scored, it was a surreal moment. You could see all the relief coming out of me and the team, everyone jumping on each other."It was the best moment of my life and probably their lives as well."Barry celebrates after scoring in his Villa debut.After the game Barry swapped shirts with Liverpool's Brazilian international Fabinho, before the teenager had second thoughts about not keeping the top in which he debuted.He ran after Fabinho, who then gave Barry back his Villa shirt -- and let the 17-year-old retain the Liverpool defender's top."The kids did really well," Klopp said. "We had problems in passing and moving. Too many on the wrong side of the ball, not enough recoveries of passes. "We had chances and shot directly at the goalie. It was rusty but better in the second half. We have a lot players with no rhythm."Barry played for Barcelona before joining Aston Villa.READ: Premier League stars condemned for Covid-19 lockdown breachCovid-19 spikeEarlier this week the English Premier League announced 40 new positive Covid-19 cases among players and club staff in its latest round of testing -- more than double from the previous week.In a statement on Tuesday the league said that between December 28 and 31, 1,311 players and club staff were tested for Covid-19 -- of these, there were 28 new positive tests.From January 1 to 3, Covid-19 tests were administered to 984 players and club staff, with 12 tests coming back positive.It is the first week players and club staff have been tested twice a week for Covid-19.As of Tuesday, four Premier League matches have been postponed this season due to Covid-19 issues.The league added that it "continues to have confidence in its COVID-19 protocols, fully backed by the Government, to enable fixtures to be played as scheduled."

929,,(CNN)French striker Karim Benzema is set to face trial for his alleged involvement in a scheme to blackmail his former teammate Mathieu Valbuena in 2015, the prosecutor of the Versailles Tribunal confirmed to CNN. The case relates to the existence of a sex tape which features Valbuena. Benzema is accused of pressuring Valbuena, who played alongside the Real Madrid star on the French national team, to pay blackmailers to prevent the video from becoming public.Benzema must answer the charge of "complicity in attempted blackmail," according to the prosecutor.Four other men, who were not named, were implicated in the case for attempted blackmail, the prosecutor told CNN. One also faces an additional breach of trust charge. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MoreWhen the investigation first started, Benzema, who was suspended by the French national team as a result, denied the allegations. He could face up to five years in prison if found guilty. Zinedine Zidane hails Karim Benzema as the greatest French striker in historyWhen asked if he blamed Benzema by Le Monde in 2015, Valbuena said that he was "very, very, very disappointed" with his former teammate, who he said showed a "lack of respect" towards him. Benzema has scored 27 goals in 81 appearances for the French national team but hasn't represented his country since the incident with Valbuena.  Representatives for Benzema and Valbuena did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.Benzema's lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told Reuters: "We are unfortunately not surprised by this decision, which is as absurd as it was expected. "I am dismayed to note that one is forced to distort the elements gathered in the investigation to justify sending my client before the tribunal. We will explain ourselves before the judges of the tribunal to demonstrate this abuse."Cormier said in 2015 that Benzema had "taken no part in this blackmail attempt" and that the case had gone public "in a fallacious manner."Real Madrid backed Benzema at the time with President Florentino Perez saying the player's actions were "in good faith."Benzema has scored more than 250 goals for Real Madrid and has won four European Cups and three La Liga titles with the Spanish club. Valbuena, 36, currently plays for Greek champion Olympiacos, which he joined in 2019. His club career has also seen his play for Marseille and Lyon in France and Fenerbahce in Turkey.  He hasn't represented the French national team since the incident with Benzema.

"Stop using the same word. It's disrespectful. It's ridiculous and it's shameful to keep calling them protesters. They're not f**king protesters, they're f**king terrorists."On Wednesday, a large crowd of Trump supporters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol before fighting with police and breaking into the building.

Many have since drawn comparisons between the police response on Wednesday to that of last year's Black Lives Matter protests.The death of George Floyd prompted hundreds of protests in the US. In many cities, police met protesters with tear gas, violence and arrests.During a protest in Washington DC last year, members of the DC National Guard, armed and wearing camouflage uniforms, stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, as crowds of BLM demonstrators held a peaceful protest.Rioters breached US Capitol security on Wednesday. This was the police response when it was Black protesters on DC streets last yearDuring Wednesday's episode, the mob had already made it inside the Capitol before the DC National Guard was even activated.Green says the difference in response shows the difficulties facing Black people in the US."To see the National Guard standing on those same steps when there was a peaceful protest and now to see a terrorist attack and no National Guard just goes to show you where this country is, where this country always has been, and probably where it's going to stay," he added."I've seen a lot of things of 'Shoot them like we would've been shot.' I don't think that's the right thing to do either. I think 'Stop shooting us,' I think that's more the battle cry." US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced he is resigning from his post following the attack, saying on Thursday that Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers were "actively attacked" with metal pipes and other weapons. Five people have died as a result of the riot so far, including one US Capitol police officer.  One woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police as the crowd breached the building and three others suffered medical emergencies that proved fatal. "The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, D.C.," Sund said in his resignation announcement. "Maintaining public safety in an open environment -- specifically for First Amendment activities -- has long been a challenge," he said.Still, lawmakers say they are perplexed at the lack of preparedness among law enforcement given that it had been known for weeks that President Trump was promoting a rally he said was aimed at preventing the certification of Joe Biden's win.

Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down. Officer Sheskey told investigators that he used deadly force during the chaotic encounter because he was afraid Blake, while attempting to flee the scene, was trying to kidnap a child in the back seat of the vehicle.The Wisconsin Department of Justice had said Blake had a knife in his possession and the weapon was found on the floorboard of his vehicle. Blake himself told authorities he possessed a knife, Graveley said. "Ironically, the news that's come out of Kenosha and these places within the same 24-hour span as that [DC riot] happens, and then you kind of see that and it's just like a slap in the face and almost a 'F**k you' to every Black person in America who goes through these things," Green said."It's almost like they want to show you that they have power and want to show you that [they] can say 'F**k you' and there's nothing you can do about it. "It just goes to show the policing system was built against Black and brown people and that's the reason those reactions are different. "That's the reason someone can walk or run, or bust their way through [...] into the Speaker of the House office and put their feet on the desk like they're sitting at home on her couch and nothing happens."

"Being a part of a household with three kids -- two boys, a daughter -- a wife, a mother-in-law and so many Black folks in my household during that time and it's on the TV, I couldn't help but to wonder, if those were my kind storming the Capitol, what would have been the outcome?

Rioters breached US Capitol security on Wednesday. This was the police response when it was Black protesters on DC streets last year"I mean, what more do I need to say to my kids than to just see the two differences? It's right there, right there in their face."Other players and coaches across American sports also spoke out following the riots, voicing similar concerns as James on the double standard of policing.

935,,London (CNN)Moderna became the third Covid-19 vaccine to be authorized for use in the UK, the country's Department of Health said in a press release on Friday.  The UK's medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), authorized the vaccine "following months of rigorous clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people and an extensive analysis of the vaccine's safety, quality and effectiveness," the Department of Health wrote. "This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease," Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement. The UK government has agreed to purchase an additional 10 million doses of the Moderna vaccine on top of its previous order of 7 million, taking the total to 17 million, the release said. Supplies will begin to be delivered to the UK from this spring once Moderna expands its production capability, it added.Read More"We have already vaccinated nearly 1.5 million people across the UK and Moderna's vaccine will allow us to accelerate our vaccination programme even further once doses become available from the spring," Hancock said. Data released in November found the Moderna vaccine was 94.5% effective against coronavirus. The company says its vaccine did not have any serious side effects. A small percentage of those who received it experienced symptoms such as body aches and headaches.Its results are similar to those of Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine because they use the same technique to activate the body's immune system.The vaccines deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, which is a genetic recipe for making the spikes that sit atop the coronavirus. Once injected, the body's immune system makes antibodies to the spikes. If a vaccinated person is later exposed to the coronavirus, those antibodies should stand at the ready to attack the virus.Moderna's vaccine can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius. Other vaccines, such as the one against chickenpox, also need to be kept at that temperature.On Wednesday, the European Commission also authorized the use of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine across the European Union's 27 member nations, hours after the European Medicines Agency recommended it do so.CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.

938,,(CNN)As the votes trickled in, millions of Americans held their breath. Arguably the most consequential election in recent US history took five days to be called in favor of the Democratic candidate Joe Biden and, for many people, the wait was unbearable.While the ballots were being tallied in states from Nevada to Pennsylvania, the baseball player Bruce Maxwell was grateful for a distraction; he was in training but still paying very close attention to the news.For Maxwell, the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election was personal and, for him, those anxious days would come to represent a conclusion of intertwining narrative arcs that were both devastating and inspiring.Growing up in Alabama, baseball has been the story of Maxwell's life; his dream was fulfilled when he arrived in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Oakland A's. But it also led him to the darkest place that anybody could imagine, contemplating the act of suicide.Read MoreSpeaking to CNN, Maxwell vividly recalled the moment when his life almost came to a premature end, a desperate hour spent alone with a gun pointing at his forehead."All I had to do was pull the trigger," he said, recalling those moments of intense despair. "I felt like I was in a never-ending hole. I couldn't talk on the phone, I couldn't talk to my family. I felt like my family and the people that knew me were better off without me."And yet, this is a man who took an historic stand in his sport, an athlete whose name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the NFL's iconic protester Colin Kaepernick or Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the American sprinters who defied the US Olympic Committee with their infamous Black power salute in 1968.In 2017, Maxwell became the first major league baseball player to take a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustice, but it took another three years for anyone else to follow his lead in the big leagues.READ: Football's fight against racism and discrimination is only just beginningBruce Maxwell kneels in protest on September 24, 2017.Maxwell always knew that he was a little different.The son of a mixed-race couple in the Deep South, he didn't see many people that looked like him. He told CNN that baseball "is not a very popular sport among the African-American community down where I'm from."As he grew up, he began to notice "there were less and less of us on the field. I felt out of place."According to a USA Today report in August 2020, only 7.8% of the league was made up of Black players.It may have felt uncomfortable at times, but baseball was also giving him a blueprint for life in general."I learned from a very early age that I love this game," he said. "The more I worked at it, the more I fell in love with it. It taught me how to fight; it taught me how to accept and grow from failure."And so that has led into my life outside of baseball and just being able to conquer and to bounce back every time I get an obstacle put in my way."In July 2016, Maxwell made his MLB debut with the A's, but it was the events that played out 14 months later that really changed his life.On September 22, 2017, President Donald Trump went to Maxwell's hometown in Huntsville, Alabama. During his address to a packed arena, Trump took aim at the NFL players who'd been kneeling during the national anthem, protesting police brutality.To a cheering crowd, Trump said: "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b*tch off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired!'"The sports world was stunned, and Maxwell took it personally."I went through these racial injustices when I was a kid and to hear our current president at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, where I'm from, and to see the amount of people in this city that supported him and showed him love was shell-shocking for me."The next day, he addressed his teammates, the staff at Oakland and the club's ownership personnel and outlined his intentions."I told them what I was going to do, gave them my reasoning, how this is something for me to do, to stand up for the people that don't have the spotlight shining on them."Ahead of the game against the Texas Rangers that Saturday, Maxwell took the knee. He immediately experienced a rush of conflicting emotions, "I was heavy hearted; I was nervous. I was almost kind of refreshed. I felt like there was a weight lifted off my shoulders, for hiding what's been going on in my life and to my own people."READ: Fans boo players taking a knee on return to stadiumMaxwell is congratulated in the dugout after hitting a two-run home run in 2017.He knew there might be consequences, but he wasn't prepared for the intensity, or the malice."There was a lot more in volume than I anticipated, and it was pretty remarkable, honestly.""I got numerous death threats for not only myself, but the rest of my family. I had people want to burn my house down, people calling me the N-word, people threatening to hang me and my family. I had a couple of people call my mom 'N-word lover.' I mean, you name it."Maxwell struggled to cope with the backlash. At the end of the season, he found himself without the support of his teammates; he was alone."Outside of saying 'we support you,' there was no substantial support. The team said: 'It's your choice', we're behind you.' They gave me the freedom to do it, they didn't object," he added."But down the road, there was no additional support. They knew I was getting death threats, they knew I was having a rough time. There was no psychological support, nobody reached out, nobody checked in."CNN reached out to the A's for comment but has not received a response to Maxwell's assertions.JUST WATCHED'Field of Dreams... Deferred': 100 years on from the Negro LeaguesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Field of Dreams... Deferred': 100 years on from the Negro Leagues 02:59Maxwell says he became depressed and paranoid and his condition reached a nadir when he pulled a gun on a food delivery driver at his front door in Scottsdale, Arizona.Nobody was hurt and he described it as a misunderstanding, but later that evening around a dozen police officers showed up at his door and arrested him on a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct with a weapon.Police bodycam footage showed him being escorted out of his residence, shirtless and barefoot. He plead guilty to the lesser charge, according to the Arizona Republic, after the state dropped the felony charge, when it agreed that Maxwell didn't point the gun at the driver, as police originally alleged. He was sentenced to two years probation.In the following season, Maxwell's form deteriorated. He was cut from the Oakland team, but he still loved baseball and he wasn't ready to walk away from the game.READ: Lewis Hamilton, Formula One's voice and conscienceMaxwell was cut from the Oakland team after his form began suffering. In the absence of interest from any other Major League team, his salvation came from just over the border, in Mexico.In 2019, Maxwell lined up for Acereros de Monclova, a team that had never before won a league title."They believed that I could lead their team to a championship for the first time ever," he said."And they believed I'd be a leader, not only for their team but their city. I respected that and I gave it a shot."What unfolded over the next few months reaffirmed his love of the game and breathed new life into Maxwell's career. "It wasn't political. It wasn't, you know, people trying to kill me. They just appreciated me coming down there and giving everything that I had. It was amazing for me."Maxwell smashed 24 home runs, leading Monclova to their first ever league championship, and in that moment of triumph, he was able to reflect on the tortured journey that had led him there."I've never been so happy before. It's probably the best thing that I've ever done on the baseball field. To see my teammates, from all over the world, come together and fight for one team in one city was a beautiful and emotional thing."Maxwell's success over the border caught the eye once again of MLB and in July he was signed by the New York Mets on a minor league deal.On November 2 -- the eve of the US election -- he was re-signed to the Mets and invited to the major league team for spring training next year. Just a few days later, the man whose hateful rhetoric inspired Maxwell to take a knee, lost his bid to remain in the White House.Maxwell described hearing the news that former Vice President Joe Biden had passed the threshold of 270 electoral college votes as "a good feeling, a relief. It was awesome."Maxwell told CNN that he felt another four years of Trump would have led to "significantly more deaths" of African American people and the possibility of martial law. He says he'd have considered staying in Mexico if Trump had won a second term."The result was a breath of fresh air for me and my family. Our country came out and set a record for the amount of voters in one election and I'm glad people took a stand for humanity and for the betterment of our country. Character does matter; treating people with respect does matter."JUST WATCHEDSports stars react to US protests over George Floyd's deathReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSports stars react to US protests over George Floyd's death 02:08From the global pandemic, to the worldwide protests about racial injustice and now an historic US presidential election, 2020 was a seismic year. And three years after Maxwell had taken a knee on the baseball field, other players found the courage to do the same.Maxwell says that he understands why it took them so long, explaining how vulnerable African American players can sometimes feel in the league."We make up a very, very small amount in Major League Baseball, including coaches. And so it makes it very hard to speak out. We're outnumbered in there." "You try to mind your P's and Q's, to stay in the game and keep your job and keep a good image. I just feel like people were afraid to take the same stance," added Maxwell.Once, he was the outlier, but now he's grateful not to be baseball's only protester. "Now people are realizing how big of a deal this really is. And it makes me feel happy because we're doing something about it. Smaller or big, there is a change coming in the game that we play."Maxwell isn't naïve enough to think that the world's problems can be solved with a few more players taking a knee or even a different president in The White House.He knows how much more work is still to be done. As he put it bluntly, "I still get these nasty looks and comments when I take my mother to dinner."But as he prepares to hopefully play Major League Baseball again next season, he is at least feeling more optimistic about the future. "I feel joyful about it," he said. "You know, I feel progressive about it, and I feel confident in the change to come."
939,,(CNN)After a turbulent summer, Lionel Messi has had an atypically slow start to the season.However, with the calendar having flipped to 2021, the Barcelona forward looks to have kicked into another gear, showing glimpses of his best. On Wednesday night, Messi scored twice and hit the woodwork twice in Barcelona's 3-2 victory over Athletic Bilbao, moving the Catalans to third in La Liga. Barcelona was forced to come from behind though, after Inaki Williams raced clear to give Bilbao the lead in just the third minute. Ronald Koeman's men returned to parity in style, with a free-flowing team move ending with Messi's deep cross being headed back by Frenkie de Jong for 18-year-old Pedri to equalize. Read MoreFrom then on, Messi stole the show, sweeping home after a cheeky backheel from Pedri to give Barcelona the lead and then adding a third with an emphatic finish after Antoine Griezmann's incisive pass split the Bilbao defense. Messi celebrates after he scores his team's second goal.His two goals put him tied with three others at the top of the goalscoring charts in Spain on nine overall. It was Messi's errant pass late on that gave Bilbao the chance to halve the deficit, but Barcelona was able to hold on to the three points to move seven behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who has two games in hand on the Catalans. While it hasn't been vintage Barcelona in recent weeks, the early season mistakes look to have been ironed out somewhat. In fact, since losing 3-0 at home to Juventus in the Champions League early in December, Barcelona has gone seven La Liga matches unbeaten, with five wins and two draws.After the game, Pedri praised the team's new-found mental toughness. "When you concede so early it's normal to drop your heads but we showed a lot of self-belief to make sure that didn't happen," the Spain under-21 international said."We knew it was an important game, that's how we approached it. We knew they'd look for Inaki (Williams) with his speed but we overcame that and got three very important points."READ: Mourinho one match away from ending Tottenham's trophy droughtBarcelona is on a seven-game unbeaten streak. Ending the runElsewhere, Federico Chiesa scored twice as Juventus produced an excellent display to beat AC Milan 3-1, ending the club's undefeated start to the Serie A season. The 23-year-old Italy international's quick one-two with Paulo Dybala unlocked the Milan defense before Davide Calabria's emphatic finish leveled the scores. Chiesa's second and Weston McKennie's goal capped off Juventus' magnificent performance and inflicted AC Milan's first league defeat since last March -- a run of 27 games, lasting 304 days.Juventus, which has won the past nine Serie A titles, now sits seven points behind league leaders AC Milan.AC Milan, without injured talisman striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Wednesday, is one point ahead of city rivals Inter Milan.

The Argentine was officially confirmed as the French champion's new coach on Saturday, following the sacking of Thomas Tuchel. Having fallen behind to Romain Hamouma's opener in the first half, Italian international Moise Kean drew PSG level. However, PSG was unable to find the net again despite having nearly 70% possession of the ball.

940,,(CNN)After rioters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday to protest Joe Biden's Electoral College victory, players and coaches across American sports leagues voiced their concerns about what they witnessed in Washington."This is what's going on. It has been incited. People can't be surprised at what's happening, because it's kind of been provoked for a long time," Seattle Seahawks offensive lineman Duane Brown said. "It's here now, and it's not being met with the same outrage and the same anger as other protests, and things that have happened over the last recent months. I'm praying for everyone involved, for safety, I believe they said some people were shot or injured so praying for the best outcome possible in those situations. But like I said, it's been provoked for a while." Players from the Bucks and Pistons kneel shortly after the start of an NBA game Wednesday.NBA players also demonstrated before and during games nationwide to recognize Jacob Blake, including kneeling during the national anthem and after the opening tip. This was the police response when it was Black protesters on DC streets last yearBlake was shot seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last August. He survived the shooting but is paralyzed from the waist down. The Kenosha County district attorney announced Tuesday that the officer, Rusten Sheskey, will not face charges.Read MoreAt the start of Wednesday's game between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat in Miami, the teams released a joint statement."2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed. We play tonight's game with a heavy heart after yesterday's decision in Kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our nation's capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on. The drastic difference between the way protesters this past spring and summer were treated and the encouragement given to today's protestors who acted illegally just shows how much more work we have to do." Players from the Celtics and Heat kneeled during the national anthem, as did the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers before their game in San Francisco. Members of the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns locked arms in a circle before their NBA game. The Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons played their NBA game less than an hour away from Kenosha. After the opening tip, players on the court from both teams took a knee. Following the game, it was revealed the gesture was for Jacob Blake, and Bucks players, including star Giannis Antetokounmpo, said it lasted seven seconds for the seven gunshots Blake took.  Athletes across US sports take a stand, as games are called off in solidarity with Bucks' boycottIn August, following the shooting of Blake, the Bucks decided to boycott their playoff game. This led to other NBA playoff games being postponed for the day, and was followed by WNBA, MLS and MLB games being called off in an act of solidarity. Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown spoke Wednesday to the dichotomy of situations faced by different parts of society."It reminds me of what Dr. Martin Luther King has said, that there is two split different Americas. In one America you get killed by sleeping in your car, selling cigarettes or playing in your back yard. In the other America, you get to storm the Capitol, and no tear gas, no massive arrests, none of that," Brown said."I think it's obvious, it's 2021, and I don't think anything has changed. We want to still acknowledge that, we want to still push for the change that we're looking for, but as of yet we have not seen it. We want to keep conversations alive and do our part," he added.Celtics teammate Jayson Tatum said, "It was heavy on our hearts. We were thinking about it.""It's tough because we're not surprised about what we see on TV. It's the world we live in. I just feel like the same energy should be kept as when we see our people peacefully protesting for things that we see our people getting murdered on TV and live and videos. They're protesting in the Capitol -- rioting in the Capitol for losing an election. It's two different things. I want the same energy on TV to be, 'They're thugs and criminals,' the same terms they used when they see our people protesting for losing our lives," Tatum said.Baltimore Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted, "The difference in the treatment between races in America is on full display."The difference in the treatment between races in America is on full display— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) January 6, 2021  Houston Texans wide receiver Randall Cobb wrote, "This is America... did they really just storm the Capitol in an attempted ...coup!?"Philadelphia 76ers head coach Doc Rivers said democracy would prevail at the end of the day, yet shared the sentiments expressed by those in the sports world.  "When you saw the protest in the summer and you saw the riots, or more the police and the national guard and the army, and then you see this and you saw nothing, it basically proves a point about a privileged life in a lot of ways," Rivers said. "I will say it because I don't think a lot of people want to. Could you imagine today, if those were all Black people storming the Capitol, and what would have happened? That, to me, is a picture that's worth a thousand words for all of us to see, and probably something for us to reckon with again."The Boston Celtics and Miami Heat kneel before an NBA game Wednesday.Other NBA coaches made pointed comments at the political climate in Washington, in particular the fires stoked by President Donald Trump and Republican senators.Warriors head coach Steve Kerr remarked, "I wish that people like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley had to do pre-game media before they meet in Congress. It would be great for them to answer the question, 'Are you happy now? Do you keep moving the line back? Does this change anything? Or are you going to continue to enable?'"Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said before their game, "I think we all hope that the people we elect to lead us are supposed to be modeling leadership will do so in a way that is motivated by serving others, by showing compassion, by acting gracefully. And instead, we elected a President who luckily is on his way out and others that have not shown that kind of grace. It's been consistent. And they just operated at a win-at-all costs attitude."In this situation, a disgraceful ending.

It just made me want more," he said.

942,,(CNN)Denmark's flagship broadcaster has suffered blowback over its newest children's TV program, "John Dillermand" -- an animation starring a man with a penis so massive and flexible it can save children from danger, fetch objects from a river and operate as a pogo stick. The show, whose 13 episodes are available to watch on the DR network's website, follows its titular character as he navigates an array of unexpected scenarios caused by his inexplicably huge genitalia.In episode one, for instance, the mustached Dillermand uses his gigantic, stripey organ as a lead for his dog -- but quickly finds himself inundated with requests from his neighbors to take their pets out for a walk, too. At another point in the show, he is stuck floating in mid-air after balloons are tied to his groin. In another episode, he breaks a friend's vase with his penis and must raise money to pay them back, and in a third, he uses it to steal an ice cream at the zoo. The show's opening montage also shows him using his genitals to keep a lion away from a group of children.A still from the program, showing one of the numerous misadventures Dillermand suffers as a result of his genitalia.The show was generally met with hilarity in Denmark and across the internet, with many praising it as an appropriate and light-hearted way to teach children about the human anatomy.Read MoreBut some took issue with the main character's central trait. Danish politician Morten Messerschmidt, a member of the right-wing Danish People's Party, said children should not be forced to watch a cartoon depiction of an adult man's groin. And a handful of parents have taken to the Facebook page of DR's children's network, urging them to remove the program.A spokesperson for DR told CNN that most of those who criticized the program did so "without even (having) seen the show, because it wasn't released yet." After 20 years on air, the children's show 'Caillou' is taking a bow"Now the great majority here in Denmark are ... making fun of the few critics instead," Sarah Cecilie added. "Hundreds of thousands is supporting 'John Dillermand' now.""In Denmark it is now a huge success, and the children are watching it in big numbers," she said, telling CNN that 200,000 people have viewed the first episode.In the network's online description of the show, they state that while Dillermand's genitals get him into embarrassing situations, it can be used for good once he embraces that he is different. DR is Denmark's oldest and most well-known broadcaster, and was a founding member of the European Broadcasting Union. The network is funded by the taxpayer, making it the Danish equivalent of the BBC or PBS.

"It is our assessment that this variant of concern may, over time, replace other circulating lineages as seen in the United Kingdom, and increasingly in Denmark," Kluge said. "With increased transmissibility and similar disease severity, the variant does, however, raise alarm: without increased control to slow its spread, there will be an increased impact on already stressed and pressurized health facilities.""This is an alarming situation, which means that for a short period of time we need to do more than we have done and to intensify the public health and social measures to be certain we can flatten the steep vertical line in some countries," Kluge added.Kluge then urged countries "to mitigate this burden by doing all they can to reduce transmission and increase vigilance to identify any new variants."A number of European nations are currently under lockdown or have imposed strict Covid-19 measures, including Britain, Italy, Germany Switzerland and Greece.

945,,London (CNN)A British judge denied bail for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, just days after she rejected a US request to extradite him to America.The US said it would appeal against the decision on Monday and asked for Assange to be remanded in custody while that process was ongoing.Judge Vanessa Baraitser said in her Wednesday ruling that "there are substantial grounds for believing that if Mr. Assange is released today he would fail to surrender to court and face the appeal proceedings."US prosecutors had argued on Wednesday that Assange had already shown he was "capable of going to extraordinary lengths to avoid extradition," noting his seven-year stay inside a Ecuadorian embassy in London. Assange's defense countered that argument, saying that as the court had ruled in favor of him in regards to the extradition order, Assange had every reason to follow the law. They offered up stringent measures to assure both the prosecution and the court that Assange would be able to abscond, including house arrest and GPS monitoring if granted bail. Read MoreBaraitser's rejected the defense's arguments, saying that Assange had "already demonstrated that he has been willing to flout the order of this court" and that "stringent conditions previously imposed upon him did nothing to prevent this."The judge's decision to deny bail comes after she ruled on Monday that while Assange would be afforded a "fair trial" in the event of extradition to the US, he should not be sent on the grounds that it would be "oppressive," by reason of his mental health. She said that that the "special administrative measures" Assange would most likely be subject to inside a US prison would have a severe, negative impact on it. Baraitser said on Monday that Assange had "remained either severely or moderately clinically depressed," throughout his stay at London's Belmarsh prison and that he was now considered a suicide risk. From Monday, the US government has 10 days to make a formal application to the UK High Court, where all extradition appeals are heard, according to Nick Vamos, a lawyer and former head of extradition at the UK's Crown Prosecution Service.Marc Raimondi, acting director of Public Affairs for the US Department of Justice said in a statement on Monday that "while we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised. In particular, the court rejected all of Mr. Assange's arguments regarding political motivation, political offense, fair trial, and freedom of speech."Raimondi added that the department would "continue to seek" Assange's extradition.The appeal is likely to be heard in the next two to three months, Vamos said.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court for his bail hearing in London on Wednesday. During this time, the 49-year-old Australian will remain in Belmarsh, where he has already served a 50-week sentence for violating bail conditions back in 2012 when he entered Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden.Assange is facing an 18-count US federal indictment for his role in publishing classified military and diplomatic cables. In April 2019, the US charged him with "conspiracy to commit computer intrusion," a charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years. In May 2019, the federal government charged Assange with a further 17 counts under the Espionage Act for his role in publishing classified military and diplomatic cables.Each of those counts carries a potential sentence of 10 years, meaning that if convicted, Assange could be sentenced to up to 175 years in jail.The US government alleges that Assange actively solicited classified information from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who obtained thousands of pages of classified material and provided Assange with diplomatic State Department cables, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. Assange's partner Stella Moris speaks outside Westminster Magistrates Court in London after he was denied bail on Wednesday.Assange's lawyers and supporters have long argued that the extradition order and charges against him are politically motivated, and that, if carried out, would have a chilling effect on press freedoms in both the US and the UK.At the start of the extradition hearing in February 2020, Assange's legal team argued that US President Donald Trump was trying to "make an example" of Assange as the trove of classified defense documents relating to Iraq and Afghanistan published by WikiLeaks revealed evidence of war crimes.Speaking outside the Westminster Magistrates Court on Wednesday, Stella Moris, Assange's partner and the mother of the couple's two children, said that Wednesday's decision was a "huge disappointment."She said "Julian should not be in Belmarsh Prison in the first place," and called on the US Department of Justice to drop the charges and for Trump to pardon him before leaving office.

Today's decision seems intended to send a message that British justice will not stand in their way."Lawyers for the US government have argued that by publishing the diplomatic cables in an unredacted form, Assange had put the lives of sources and informants in "immediate" danger, and damaged the capabilities of US forces carrying out operations abroad."Reporting or journalism is not a license for criminality," James Lewis, Counsel for the US government told the court last year.
946,,(CNN)The European Union has authorized Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, the second coronavirus vaccine to be approved for use in the EU. The move finalizes the recommendation of the European Union drugs regulator, who earlier on Wednesday recommended granting the drug a conditional marketing authorization.Emer Cooke, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) executive director, said on Wednesday that "this vaccine provides us with another tool to overcome the current emergency."The EU is plagued with divisions. Covid-19 vaccines are a golden chance to redeem the European project"It is a testament to the efforts and commitment of all involved that we have this second positive vaccine recommendation just short of a year since the pandemic was declared by WHO," she said.The EU has secured the purchase of up to 160 million doses of the Moderna vaccine -- enough to vaccinate 80 million people of its 448 million citizens -- as part of a joint vaccine strategy aimed to ensure equitable access across the bloc. Read MoreUnder that contract, the US biotech firm has promised to deliver all their doses between now and September 2021, the European commission said. Moderna said in a statement that the first deliveries of their vaccine "from Moderna's dedicated non-US supply chain are expected to begin next week."Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission celebrated Wednesday's outcome, saying that "we are providing more Covid-19 vaccines for Europeans. With the Moderna vaccine...we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come."Noting that Europe has secured up to 2 billion doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines, von der Leyen added, "We'll have more than enough safe and effective vaccines for protecting all Europeans."Stella Kyriakides, the EU's Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said that "we are all in this together and united," adding that a"our efforts will not stop until vaccines are available for everyone in the EU."Kyriakides also said that member states will "have to ensure that the pace of vaccinations follows suit."The 27-member bloc is already facing logistical challenges in rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the EU purchased 300 millon doses of and which was authorized for use on December 21 and rolled out just days later. A challenging processIn France, as of January 1, the amount of people vaccinated stood at a paltry 516, according to data made available by the French health agency.That rate seems to undermine the promise of French Prime Minister Jean Castex, who said that 1 million people would able to be vaccinated by the end of the month.Jean Rottner, the head of France's "Great East" region, which has been badly impacted by the second wave, said that the slow vaccination rate is "a state scandal,"  and that he wanted territories to "take over" from the government. Here's how mutations could help the coronavirus evade vaccines"We are making fun of ourselves because today, being vaccinated has become more complicated than buying a car," Rottner said on public broadcaster France 2."We need to accelerate, we are at war," he said, adding that "today, we need to vaccinate everywhere we can, with the means that are at our disposal."The German government has also come under pressure from both politicians and scientific experts for not securing enough doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to roll out its vaccination program.Germany has immunized 316,962 people -- around 0.4% of the country's population -- according to Tuesday's data from the Robert Koch Institute, the national agency for disease control and prevention.  Among those vaccinated were around 131,885 residents of nursing homes and around 149,727 medical staff, according to data collected from Germany's federal states. German health minister Jens Spahn rejected criticism of the delay in inoculations, saying in an interview with public broadcaster ARD on Tuesday that vaccination doses currently available in Germany are "exactly the order of magnitude I have been announcing for weeks."At the same time, Spahn emphasized that efforts to procure more vaccine doses for Germany are underway, with authorities "very actively" supporting the construction of a new BioNTech production plant in Marburg. Experts have warned that the biggest challenge for the EU will be the actual rollout of the vaccine, given that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shot, which uses new mRNA technology, differs significantly from other more traditional vaccines in terms of storage.Moderna's vaccine can be stored at temperatures of -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for up to six months and at refrigerator temperatures of 2-8C (35-46F) for up to 30 days. It can also be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours, and doesn't need to be diluted prior to use.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine presents more complex logistical challenges, as it must be stored at around -70C (-94F) and lasts just five days in a refrigerator. Vials of the drug also need to be diluted for injection; once diluted, they must be used within six hours, or thrown out.Vaccine candidates such as Oxford/AstraZeneca's offering -- which is already being distributed in the UK and which experts believe is likely to be approved by European regulators next -- can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures for at least six months, a benefit to those countries which are ill-equipped to handle the additional demands of cold-chain storage.A strong cold-chain network is just one aspect when it comes to effectively distributing vaccines, however.  Other factors such as monitoring systems, community engagement and human resourcing are also all crucial to a successful rollout.

21038,,This paper addresses the problem of RGBD object recognition in real-world applications, where large amounts of annotated training data are typically unavailable. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel, weakly-supervised learning architecture (DCNN-GPC) which combines parametric models (a pair of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for RGB and D modalities) with non-parametric models (Gaussian Process Classification). Our system is initially trained using a small amount of labeled data, and then automatically prop- agates labels to large-scale unlabeled data. We first run 3D- based objectness detection on RGBD videos to acquire many unlabeled object proposals, and then employ DCNN-GPC to label them. As a result, our multi-modal DCNN can be trained end-to-end using only a small amount of human annotation. Finally, our 3D-based objectness detection and multi-modal DCNN are integrated into a real-time detection and recognition pipeline. In our approach, bounding-box annotations are not required and boundary-aware detection is achieved. We also propose a novel way to pretrain a DCNN for the depth modality, by training on virtual depth images projected from CAD models. We pretrain our multi-modal DCNN on public 3D datasets, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on Washington RGBS Dataset. We then finetune the network by further training on a small amount of annotated data from our novel dataset of industrial objects (nuclear waste simulants). Our weakly supervised approach has demonstrated to be highly effective in solving a novel RGBD object recognition application which lacks of human annotations.  
21039,,Deep learning methods achieve great success recently on many computer vision problems, with image classification and object detection as the prominent examples. In spite of these practical successes, optimization of deep networks remains an active topic in deep learning research. In this work, we focus on investigation of the network solution properties that can potentially lead to good performance. Our research is inspired by theoretical and empirical results that use orthogonal matrices to initialize networks, but we are interested in investigating how orthogonal weight matrices perform when network training converges. To this end, we propose to constrain the solutions of weight matrices in the orthogonal feasible set during the whole process of network training, and achieve this by a simple yet effective method called Singular Value Bounding (SVB). In SVB, all singular values of each weight matrix are simply bounded in a narrow band around the value of 1. Based on the same motivation, we also propose Bounded Batch Normalization (BBN), which improves Batch Normalization by removing its potential risk of ill-conditioned layer transform. We present both theoretical and empirical results to justify our proposed methods. Experiments on benchmark image classification datasets show the efficacy of our proposed SVB and BBN. In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art results of 3.06% error rate on CIFAR10 and 16.90% on CIFAR100, using off-the-shelf network architectures (Wide ResNets). Our preliminary results on ImageNet also show the promise in large-scale learning.  
21040,,The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a widely used feature descriptor in computer vision for the purpose of object detection. In the paper, a modified HOG descriptor is described, it uses a lookup table and the method of integral image to speed up the detection performance by a factor of 5~10. By exploiting the special hardware features of a given platform(e.g. a digital signal processor), further improvement can be made to the HOG descriptor in order to have real-time object detection and tracking.  
21041,,Determining the material category of a surface from an image is a demanding task in perception that is drawing increasing attention. Following the recent remarkable results achieved for image classification and object detection utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we empirically study material classification of everyday objects employing these techniques. More specifically, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of how state-of-the art CNN architectures compare on a common ground over widely used material databases. Experimental results on three challenging material databases show that the best performing CNN architectures can achieve up to 94.99\% mean average precision when classifying materials. 
21042,,Object detection and recognition is an important task in many computer vision applications. In this paper an Android application was developed using Eclipse IDE and OpenCV3 Library. This application is able to detect objects in an image that is loaded from the mobile gallery, based on its color, shape, or local features. The image is processed in the HSV color domain for better color detection. Circular shapes are detected using Circular Hough Transform and other shapes are detected using Douglas-Peucker algorithm. BRISK (binary robust invariant scalable keypoints) local features were applied in the developed Android application for matching an object image in another scene image. The steps of the proposed detection algorithms are described, and the interfaces of the application are illustrated. The application is ported and tested on Galaxy S3, S6, and Note1 Smartphones. Based on the experimental results, the application is capable of detecting eleven different colors, detecting two dimensional geometrical shapes including circles, rectangles, triangles, and squares, and correctly match local features of object and scene images for different conditions. The application could be used as a standalone application, or as a part of another application such as Robot systems, traffic systems, e-learning applications, information retrieval and many others. 
21043,,In CNN-based object detection methods, region proposal becomes a bottleneck when objects exhibit significant scale variation, occlusion or truncation. In addition, these methods mainly focus on 2D object detection and cannot estimate detailed properties of objects. In this paper, we propose subcategory-aware CNNs for object detection. We introduce a novel region proposal network that uses subcategory information to guide the proposal generating process, and a new detection network for joint detection and subcategory classification. By using subcategories related to object pose, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both detection and pose estimation on commonly used benchmarks. 
21044,,We present a new public dataset with a focus on simulating robotic vision tasks in everyday indoor environments using real imagery. The dataset includes 20,000+ RGB-D images and 50,000+ 2D bounding boxes of object instances densely captured in 9 unique scenes. We train a fast object category detector for instance detection on our data. Using the dataset we show that, although increasingly accurate and fast, the state of the art for object detection is still severely impacted by object scale, occlusion, and viewing direction all of which matter for robotics applications. We next validate the dataset for simulating active vision, and use the dataset to develop and evaluate a deep-network-based system for next best move prediction for object classification using reinforcement learning. Our dataset is available for download at cs.unc.edu/~ammirato/active_vision_dataset_website/. 
21045,,Weakly-supervised object detection (WOD) is a challenging problems in computer vision. The key problem is to simultaneously infer the exact object locations in the training images and train the object detectors, given only the training images with weak image-level labels. Intuitively, by simulating the selective attention mechanism of human visual system, saliency detection technique can select attractive objects in scenes and thus is a potential way to provide useful priors for WOD. However, the way to adopt saliency detection in WOD is not trivial since the detected saliency region might be possibly highly ambiguous in complex cases. To this end, this paper first comprehensively analyzes the challenges in applying saliency detection to WOD. Then, we make one of the earliest efforts to bridge saliency detection to WOD via the self-paced curriculum learning, which can guide the learning procedure to gradually achieve faithful knowledge of multi-class objects from easy to hard. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully bridge saliency detection and WOD tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art object detection results under the weak supervision. 
21046,,Object detection aims to identify instances of semantic objects of a certain class in images or videos. The success of state-of-the-art approaches is attributed to the significant progress of object proposal and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Most promising detectors involve multi-task learning with an optimization objective of softmax loss and regression loss. The first is for multi-class categorization, while the latter is for improving localization accuracy. However, few of them attempt to further investigate the hardness of distinguishing different sorts of distracting background regions (i.e., negatives) from true object regions (i.e., positives). To improve the performance of classifying positive object regions vs. a variety of negative background regions, we propose to incorporate triplet embedding into learning objective. The triplet units are formed by assigning each negative region to a meaningful object class and establishing class- specific negatives, followed by triplets construction. Over the benchmark PASCAL VOC 2007, the proposed triplet em- bedding has improved the performance of well-known FastRCNN model with a mAP gain of 2.1%. In particular, the state-of-the-art approach OHEM can benefit from the triplet embedding and has achieved a mAP improvement of 1.2%. 
21047,,Object detection when provided image-level labels instead of instance-level labels (i.e., bounding boxes) during training is an important problem in computer vision, since large scale image datasets with instance-level labels are extremely costly to obtain. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by developing an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based object detection method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method is applicable to both the weakly-supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark show that (1) in the weakly supervised setting, our method provides significant detection performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, (2) having access to a small number of strongly (instance-level) annotated images, our method can almost match the performace of the fully supervised Fast RCNN. We share our source code at https://github.com/ZiangYan/EM-WSD. 
21048,,Visual relations, such as "person ride bike" and "bike next to car", offer a comprehensive scene understanding of an image, and have already shown their great utility in connecting computer vision and natural language. However, due to the challenging combinatorial complexity of modeling subject-predicate-object relation triplets, very little work has been done to localize and predict visual relations. Inspired by the recent advances in relational representation learning of knowledge bases and convolutional object detection networks, we propose a Visual Translation Embedding network (VTransE) for visual relation detection. VTransE places objects in a low-dimensional relation space where a relation can be modeled as a simple vector translation, i.e., subject + predicate $\approx$ object. We propose a novel feature extraction layer that enables object-relation knowledge transfer in a fully-convolutional fashion that supports training and inference in a single forward/backward pass. To the best of our knowledge, VTransE is the first end-to-end relation detection network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VTransE over other state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets: Visual Relationship and Visual Genome. Note that even though VTransE is a purely visual model, it is still competitive to the Lu's multi-modal model with language priors. 
21049,,Most of computer vision focuses on what is in an image. We propose to train a standalone object-centric context representation to perform the opposite task: seeing what is not there. Given an image, our context model can predict where objects should exist, even when no object instances are present. Combined with object detection results, we can perform a novel vision task: finding where objects are missing in an image. Our model is based on a convolutional neural network structure. With a specially designed training strategy, the model learns to ignore objects and focus on context only. It is fully convolutional thus highly efficient. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in one important accessibility task: finding city street regions where curb ramps are missing, which could help millions of people with mobility disabilities.
